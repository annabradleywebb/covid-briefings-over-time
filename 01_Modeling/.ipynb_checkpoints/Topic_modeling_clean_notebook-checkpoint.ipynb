just had a meeting with kevin mccarthy future speaker of the house i hope  and he’s done a fantastic job for the people of california  and also the people of california have done a fantastic job when you look at the — at the bump  you take a look at the bump and how they’re doing out there  so i congratulate everybody out there but i thought i’d have kevin say a few words  so kevin please leader mccarthy  well thank you mr president  and i would like to thank you  on the basis of california governor newsom says the work that you’re doing together has been — you’re working very closely — has been effective in california as well — the vice president and the president you know today mr president i want to thank you especially for the work that secretary mnuchin has done especially for small businesses  just today alone i saw bank of america had more than  loans in two hours and for anybody who’s in small business — my first small business was when i was  years old  you don’t have income coming in right now you get a loan but for your rent paying your employees and paying your utilities is a grant  that’s part of the cares act  and i think you’re going to find that a lot of small businesses are going to hire people back keep them afloat through the next two months and get this economy moving again as we get through this virus  so i just want to thank you for all that work the president  thank you  great job you’re doing leader mccarthy  thank you the president  thank you  you go ahead  i’ll talk to you later okay thank you very much everybody  and i want to start by saying that our hearts go out to the people of new york as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in america  that seems to be the hotspot right now  but you have some others as you know that are very — very bad  very bad  louisiana is getting hit very hard  parts of michigan are getting hit very very hard  new jersey is — is –surprisingly it’s much greater than anybody would have thought  they’re doing a really good job  the governor is doing a really good job out there new york’s first responders emts doctors nurses are showing incredible courage under pressure  they’re the best in the world  we will take every action and we’ll spare no resource — financial medical scientific  we will not spare anything  we’ll get it back into shape the empire state — the governor is doing an excellent job  they’re all working very hard together  at the request of the governor as you know the javits center we have  beds and we’re going to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be looked after the patients can be looked after  that was going to be for regular medical problems such as accidents  and you know it’s very interesting the governor is telling me we don’t have too many accidents and very few people driving so we’re going to put that facility into play which is a big facility  the ship will be staying the way it is but we’re putting that facility into play to help them and today also the cdc is announcing additional steps americans can take to defend against the transmission of the virus  from recent studies we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood  so you don’t seem to have symptoms and it still gets transferred in light of these studies the cdc is advising the use of nonmedical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure  so it’s voluntary you don’t have to do it  they suggested for a period of time  but this is voluntary  i don’t think i’m going to be doing it but you have a lot of ways — you can look at it as follows the cdc is recommending that americans wear a basic cloth or a fabric mask that can be either purchased online or simply made at home  probably material that you’d have at home  these face coverings can be easily washed or reused i want to emphasize that the cdc is not recommending the use of medicalgrade or surgicalgrade masks and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard and doing some job  medical protective gear must be reserved for the frontline healthcare workers who are performing those vital services the new mask guidelines also do not replace cdc’s guidance on social distancing including staying in your home when possible standing at least six feet apart for a period of time  again we’re going to all come back together here  we’re going to all come back together  and practicing hand hygiene which we should do anyway a lot of things i think are going to spill over  shaking hands maybe will stay with our country for a long time beyond this  one of the — one of our great doctors was telling me that — as you know we have flus every year and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial  and said that if they didn’t shake hands that number would be substantially lower  so maybe it’ll stay  maybe some of these things long term will be good  but those guidelines are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection so with the masks it’s going to be really a voluntary thing  you can do it  you don’t have to do it  i’m choosing not to do it but some people may want to do it and that’s okay  it may be good  probably will  they’re making a recommendation  it’s only a recommendation  it’s voluntary we’re also taking action to ensure the cost of no barrier to any american seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus  the largest insurer nationwide the bluecross blueshield system has now announced that it will not require any copays — which is really something that’s a tremendous statement — from patients of the virus treatment for the next  days similar to the commitments of cigna humana anthem  those are great companies and they’re all doing the same thing  so copays  for them to do that is — it’s a big statement  we appreciate it today i can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treating uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government using funds from the economic relief package congress passed last month  so that was as per the question yesterday and actually the day before yesterday  this should alleviate any concern uninsured americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment  so that’s i think answers the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people i’m also signing a directive invoking the defense production act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supplies by unscrupulous actors and profiteers the security and secretary — the secretary of homeland security will work with fema to prevent the export of  respirators surgical masks gloves and other personal protective equipment  we need these items immediately for domestic use  we have to have them  but we’ve done really well with the purchase of items and you’ll be hearing about that shortly we’ve already leveraged the dpa to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supplies  under that authority this week the department of health and human services working with the department of justice took custody of nearly   respirators  surgical masks  gloves as well as bottles — many many many bottles — and disinfectant sprays that were being hoarded  all of this material is now being given to healthcare workers  most of it has already been given out  and we’ve given a lot to new york a lot in new jersey a lot to other places in addition to ensure that healthcare workers in new york have the protective equipment they need the federal government in the name of the department of defense is providing about  million  respirators  department of defense  and we’ve already given  of them to new york city  mayor de blasio needed them very badly so we got them to mayor de blasio in new york city  and they were very grateful   million  and we’re going to be increasing that number from  million to more  that’s a lot of  respirators today my team spoke with the ceo of ochsner health and the ceo of lcmc the two largest health systems in new orleans  they said they feel that they currently have enough ventilators — i think a lot of people are going to have enough ventilators — and masks and appreciate what we did and all of the things we’ve been doing with them working with them the ceo of ochsner warner thomas — who’s really been fantastic i have to say — indicated a need for  surgical gowns  and i instructed fema to deliver them tomorrow  so they’ll have the   that’s louisiana — new orleans  two hundred and thirty thousand surgical gowns they’ll have them by tomorrow we’re expanding the role of the armed forces in our response effort because no one is better prepared to win a war than the united states military  and we are in a war  the invisible enemy — remember over  retired army medical personnel have answered their nation’s call and are now supporting field hospitals and medical facilities all across the country like what i just told you that governor cuomo requested we do something in javits where we take it over  and we’re going to have that manned by the military because it’s very tough to get people — more people in the new york area  so we’re going to have it manned by the military — javits center national guard members have been activated to help states build new treatment centers and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supplies  that includes national guard  the national guard is assisting very strongly because the states were in many cases unable to have the delivery capability from warehouses and other places that we put the supplies  so i’ve given approval to use the national guards — the various national guards in the different states  and they’re doing a fantastic job of not only protecting people but delivering material the army corps of engineers has assessed more than  facilities in all  states and is rapidly building temporary hospitals and alternative care sites in many states in new york new jersey michigan pennsylvania arizona california colorado florida illinois new mexico oregon washington wisconsin ohio  they’re doing a lot of work in just those states plus additionals that are being — will be announced probably tomorrow  but they’re doing some job  the army corps of engineers — what a job they’re doing  and fema — what a job they’re doing as we deploy the power of our military we’re also deploying the skill of our doctors scientists and medical researchers  we continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies and the treatment and prevention of the virus  and we will keep the american people fully informed on our findings  hydroxychloroquine — i don’t know it’s looking like it’s having some good results  i hope that — that would be a phenomenal thing but we have it right now in — approximately now it’s increased to  people  i spoke with dr zucker in new york — terrific guy by the way  he’s — we’re doing a good job  and i spoke to governor cuomo last evening and this morning about it  so it’s been there for about three and a half days but i think — and many other places it’s being tested too  and we have a tremendous supply of it  we’ve ordered it in the case that it works  and it’s — it could have some pretty big impacts  and we’ll see what happens my administration is also working to get relief to american workers and businesses  on day one of the paycheck protection program as kevin said more than  billion in guaranteed loans have been processed to help small businesses keep their workers employed during the unprecedented time — this unprecedented time and bank of america has been incredible  of the big banks bank of america has really stepped forward and done a great job and then you have the community banks your smaller banks  and we’re already at  billion going out to incredible people  but that’s way ahead of schedule the sba and the treasury are working around the clock and our banking partners are really incredible  and they’re ensuring that the money gets to small businesses as quickly as possible and then the small business in turn take care of employees that they would have had to let go and now they’ll keep them  and that’s good  and then they’re going to open for business and they’re going to have their employees  and we’ll try and get back to where we were  eventually we’re going to supersede where we were the energy industry has been especially hard hit in the crisis  this afternoon i met with greg garland of phillips  dave hager of devon energy harold hamm of continental resources jeff hildebrand of hilcorp energy vicki hollub of occidental petroleum mike sommers of the american petroleum institute kelcy warren of energy transfer partners mike wirth of chevron and darren woods of exxon mobil  i informed them that we will be making space available in the strategic petroleum reserve to let american producers store surplus oil that can be sold at a later time there’s a tremendous abundance of oil primarily because of the virus  the virus has just stopped demand of everything including oil  so we’re working with our great energy companies  these are great companies  they employ tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people  and they’ve kept america really going for a long time  and no big price hikes no big anything  i mean they’ve just kept it going  and now they got hit  but with all the jobs and all of the good that they do we’re going to make sure that they stay in good shape america is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens our future society  our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time  and we want them to stay healthy for a long time  so stay at home  this is ending  this will end  you’ll see some bad things and then you’re going to see some really good things  and it’s not going to be too long we will heal our citizens and we will care for our neighbors and we will unleash the full might of the united states of america to vanquish the virus and with that i’d like to ask mike pence to come up vice president and say a few words  and we’ll have a couple of other quick talks on a couple of subjects and we’ll take questions and it’s a beautiful friday in washington dc and our country is a great place and we’re getting better  we’re getting better very quickly this was artificially induced  we just said — they said “close it down  you have to close it down  we closed it down and we’re healing  we’re going to get it better fast so mike if you could come up say a few words  please the vice president  thank you mr president  the president just outlined a number of the decisions that he made today on the unanimous recommendation to the white house coronavirus task force in addition some good news dr deborah birx will reflect on in a moment  and some of the areas across america where we see evidence that the mitigation efforts — the american people putting into practice the president’s coronavirus guidelines — are having a positive effect in fact today california and washington state where the coronavirus first emerged in our country remain — the cases remain at a steady but low rate  and we know as governor newsom said yesterday that they’re not out of the woods yet  we continue to flow resources but we want to commend people in those states and all across the country who are putting into practice the social distancing and all the measures that state and local leaders are advising and that — and that the president has been advising in the coronavirus guidelines for america we’re also continuing to track significant outbreaks in new york state new orleans detroit chicago and boston  and as the president indicated we’re prioritizing resources to support healthcare workers and to support those that are dealing with the coronavirus in those communities on the subject of testing now more than  million tests have been performed across the country  and as you all are aware some  americans have tested positive for the coronavirus abbott instruments which now can perform a  test across the country have literally  of their machines across the nation today  but at the president’s direction fema is acquiring over  more machines to distribute to every state public health lab in america and also to our indian healthcare service and the big news of course over the last few days was that the fda — once again in near record time — has approved an antibody test developed by cellex  and we’re continuing on the white house coronavirus task force to examine ways that we can scale up these rapid tests and these innovative new tests not just to meet this moment but to lay a foundation for testing across the nation in the months ahead as the president mentioned he met with energy executives today and continues to engage with leaders of businesses all across the nation we also have held a teleconference today with commercial retailers  on the president’s behalf we thanked them for the way that people that operate malls and shopping centers around the country have embraced and enacted the coronavirus guidelines for america  it’s had enormous impact on their businesses and their industries  but i heard — i heard from them their — their patriotic commitment to put the health of their associates and their customers first  and it was deeply inspiring on the subject of supplies the president detailed our work in that space  it continues to this day  as part of our air bridge we had a flight arrive from china today to columbus ohio  we continue to work each and every day watching the data about cases to ensure that in particular not just the personal protective equipment is available for the healthcare workers that are on the frontlines but also that ventilators are available as the — as this epidemic makes its way through regions and communities  we are literally working hour by hour day by day to make sure that patients families and healthcare providers have the equipment and the support that they need as the president mentioned we’ve seen over a billion and a half dollars in loans go out through the paycheck protection program today we have available for questions the head of the cdc today to speak about the new guidance on cloth face coverings and secretary azar in a few moments will explain just how the president’s decision to make sure that no american will ever have to worry about paying for testing or for coronavirus treatment i’m pleased to report at the president’s direction medicaid and medicare already expanded to coronavirus treatment and testing early on and of course the president just indicated how major insurance companies across the country are not just waiving copays on testing but they’re now waiving copays for at least  days on any coronavirus treatment but now as secretary azar will enumerate now we’ll make sure that any american even those that have no insurance will be able to receive treatment in a hospital and never have to worry about the bill i’ll just give a general reminder to every american there is evidence across the country that you’re putting into practice the coronavirus guidelines for america  every american has a role to play  and i want to thank you on behalf of the president and all of the american people for the way that you’re stepping forward you’re engaging in the social distancing and doing the things that will slow the spread we encourage you to keep on keeping on  and we will get through this america  we will get through the coronavirus to that day of renewed health and renewed prosperity that the president always describes  but we’ll get through there sooner and we’ll get through there when we work together dr birx dr birx  thank you mr vice president mr president  thank you for your words of discipline and determination  i guess that really describes what we’re asking every american to really be disciplined about these guidelines and really determined to stay in that space of execution you know we are just in week three on — of this full guidance measure  we really do appreciate the work of the citizens of california and washington state because we do see that their curve is different  their curve is different from new york new jersey and connecticut  and we really believe that the work that every citizen is doing in those states is making a difference and it will make a difference for the frontline healthcare providers we also are deeply grateful despite the way their curve looks today they continue to get ready for a different potential so that they can ensure that patients if they do get sick have options and availability to all the frontline healthcare workers in the — what we have referred to as “hot zones” — areas where the number of cases are quite significant — the new orleans the new york city metro area including new jersey and connecticut — the incredible work that the frontline healthcare workers are providing  we’re really working now at a much more granular level talking directly to hospitals to ensure that they have the supplies that they need in coordination with state and local governments and to work — i think we discussed it yesterday but i think it was quite clear also — and reiterated by governor cuomo today — that we have to support one another as each of these different metro areas and other areas move through their peak of new infections when we talked about it at the beginning of this week we talked about this week and next week being incredibly difficult  and we want to recognize the number of americans who have lost their lives to this virus and recognize the sacrifice that healthcare providers are making both in their care but i think i’m very uplifted by hearing their messages to families and their compassion for others to provide that kind of support to the individuals in the hospital we continue to watch in addition the chicago area the detroit area and have some developing concerns around colorado the district of columbia and pennsylvania  so as you can see each of these will follow their own curves  we’ll be getting more and more of those case over time information in a very granular way to each and every one of you so that we can follow these epidemiologic curves as each of these states counties and communities move through this together in solidarity and really ensuring that we can move supplies creatively around the country to meet the needs of both the frontline healthcare providers but also every american who needs our support right now thank you the president  thank you very much secretary azar  well thank you mr president for your continued leadership as we battle the coronavirus  first i want to thank all of the members of the hhs team and the frontline healthcare workers across america including those who — those service workers who serve in our hospitals at our healthcare facilities those who clean those who deliver those who stock the shelves — all those who are going into battle every day against the virus  your country has asked you to serve as never before and you have responded heroically i’m going to provide a brief update on the administration’s plans to cover the testing and treatment for the uninsured  getting the uninsured access to the care they need is a top priority for president trump  we are already rolling out the  billion in funding from the families first coronavirus response act to cover providers’ expenses for testing and diagnosing the uninsured the cares act signed by the president includes another  billion for healthcare providers  under the president’s direction we will use a portion of that funding to cover providers’ costs of delivering  care for the uninsured sending the money to providers through the same mechanism used for testing as a condition of receiving funds under this program providers will be forbidden from balance billing the uninsured for the cost of their care  providers will be reimbursed at medicare rates we will soon have more specifics on how the rest of the  billion will go to providers  we’re working to ensure that this funding is distributed in a way that is fast fair simple and transparent i’d also like to remind people that if you’ve lost employer insurance coverage you have insurance options that you should look into  you’d be eligible for a special enrollment period on the healthcare exchanges and depending on your state you may be eligible for medicaid just as president trump is working to ensure that  treatment is paid for he’s working to support new treatment options for patients  thanks to the president’s leadership many providers are trying different experimental therapies and we need as much data as we can collect as quickly as possible on how these treatments are working today oracle has developed and is donating to the government and the american people a web portal and platform to gather crowdsourced realtime information from providers about how patients respond to potential therapeutics  while this doesn’t replace the important work of clinical trials it gives us data rapidly  if you are a doctor or a healthcare provider and you would like to help us you can sign up today to begin reporting on your work  there’s a special registration page for providers at  thank you very much the president  thank you very much  okay let’s go  steve    if we could draw you out a little bit more on the advice on face masks  what do — what would people gain from wearing a mask  and why are you opposed to wearing one yourself the president  well i just don’t want to wear one myself  it’s a recommendation they recommend it  i’m feeling good  i just don’t want to be doing — i don’t know somehow sitting in the oval office behind that beautiful resolute desk — the great resolute desk — i think wearing a face mask as i greet presidents prime ministers dictators kings queens i don’t know  somehow i don’t see it for myself  i just — i just don’t  maybe i’ll change my mind but this will pass and hopefully it’ll pass very quickly now with that being said if somebody wants to — i mean most people can just make something out of a certain material  so it’s very well designated it’s very simple to do  i won’t be doing it personally  it’s a recommendation  okay and would you like to say something about that surgeon general adams  sure  absolutely the president  surgeon general please surgeon general adams  well thank you mr president mr vice president mr secretary and cdc director redfield  i especially want to thank the folks at the cdc  and it’s a great question that you ask it’s a fair question that you ask  i want to unpack the evolution of our guidance on masks because it has been confusing to the american people first of all i want people to understand that the cdc the world health organization my office and most public health and health organizations and professionals originally recommended against the general public wearing masks because based on the best evidence available at the time it was not deemed that that would have a significant impact on whether or not a healthy person wearing a mask would contract  we have always recommended that symptomatic people wear a mask because if you’re coughing if you have a fever if you’re symptomatic you could transmit disease to other people what has changed in our recommendation  well it’s important to know that we now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms  they’re what we call asymptomatic  and that even those who eventually become presymptomatic meaning that they will develop symptoms in the future can transmit the virus to others before they show symptoms  this means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity for example coughing speaking or sneezing even if those people were not exhibiting symptoms in light of this new evidence cdc recommends and the task force recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain  these include places like grocery stores and pharmacies  we especially recommend this in areas of significant communitybased transmission  it is critical and the president mentioned this the vice president mentioned this it’s critical to emphasize that maintaining six feet of social distancing remains key to slowing the spread of the virus but cdc is additionally advising the use of simple cloth coverings to slow the spread of the virus and to help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others the cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or  respirators  those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders as recommended by the current cdc guidance as the president also mentioned cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional voluntary public health measure this recommendation complements and does not replace the president’s coronavirus guidelines for america “ days to slow the spread” which remains the cornerstone of our national effort to slow the spread of the virus cdc is always — always looking at the data  we told you that from the beginning — dr birx says it every single press conference — we’re looking at the data we’re evolving our recommendations and new recommendations will come as the evidence dictates so i want to say if you do choose to wear a face mask — very important — wash your hands first because you don’t want to put on a face covering with a dirty hand  do not touch your face while you are wearing the face covering because again you could take materials from the surface germs from the surface and bring it to your face  if you choose to wear a face covering please — please leave the  mask the medical supplies for the medical professionals healthcare workers and frontline workers know that this is not a substitute for social distancing  and remember this is all about me protecting you and you protecting me  this is about us coming together as communities  and if people voluntarily choose to wear a face covering they’re wearing it to protect their neighbors from getting the coronavirus because again they could have asymptomatic spread so mr president thank you very much for that the president  thank you  thank you surgeon general adams  appreciate the opportunity to update everyone the president  great job  thank you okay  jon    mr president dr fauci last night recommended — said that every state should have stayathome orders right now  do you agree with that  should every state in this country have the kind of stayathome orders that we now see in places like washington and new york the president  i leave it up to the governors  the governors know what they’re doing  they’ve been doing a great job  i guess we’re close to  percent anyway  and the states that we’re talking about are not in jeopardy  no i would leave it to the governors  i like — i like that from the standpoint of governing and i like that from the standpoint of even our constitution please    mr president to address the shortage in the blood supply the food and drug administration announced yesterday — the president  well i pointed to him  right    thanks mr president the president  i knew we inaudible  i heard a different voice  i heard a different voice go ahead  we’ll get you later    going to the oil meeting previously — the president  yeah    — is the us willing to cut domestic oil production  what came out of the meeting  what was the consensus the president  well a lot of things came out  it’s a great industry it’s an important industry it’s a tremendous jobproducing industry  and it’s just vital  and it was also very interesting because they all were given the test before they came into the room  so you have the head of exxon mobil you have all these guys taking the test and they all passed with flying colors  so that was good  they left happy in that respect at least there’s just an overabundance of oil right now — oil and gas  tremendous overabundance  and it was caused — they were doing a great job  they were producing a lot of energy  but then you have the virus come along and it knocked another  percent maybe  percent off of the market so there’s too much oil  there’s a glut  and these are great companies and they’ll figure it out  it’s free market  we’ll figure it out    you spoke to president putin  i mean what’s on the table here with him — the president  and with the crown prince  both    yeah the president  they were having a competition  we’ll see how it all works out  i think it’s going to work out very well  it’s going to take a long time to — to get rid of that  there’s massive excess amount of oil and gas  massive  like probably there’s never been so where that does work out well i guess you could say is for drivers  i think in certain locations it’s down to  and  cents a gallon right now on the road but we have a tremendous industry a great industry  a tremendously important industry from the standpoint of jobs  and we’re energy independent  we have to make sure we keep it that way all right please  go ahead    mr president as i was saying the food and drug administration to address the shortage of blood supply announced yesterday it would ease the restrictions on certain donors including gay men who are now required to be abstinent for  months as opposed to  months to donate  did you have a hand in that change the president  no i didn’t know anything about that  that was done by the fda — very capable people at the fda please go ahead    yes mr president  both the government of canada and  are pushing back on this dpa not to export  respirators the president  yeah     says — the president  i don’t blame them  they can push back if they want    yeah but they’re saying — the president  we’re not happy with   we’re not happy  and the people that dealt with it directly are not at all happy with  so we’ll see whether or not we do  i heard what he had to say today  i don’t know the gentleman  but we’re not happy with   go ahead    and where is dr fauci the president  i don’t know  but every time you ask that question — whenever he’s not here you look you say “where is he  and you’ll say “is there a problem  no problem whatsoever  every time he’s not here — sometimes i’ll ask him to come because that’s the first question that you and a couple of others from the fake news establishment ask is “where is dr fauci  we’re doing great together    a different subject if i may ask the president  except we’re covering a different subject today go ahead    a different subject if i may ask the president   go ahead jim  try another one    mr president you have you have said nobody could have seen this pandemic coming but in fact secretary azar at a biodefense summit in april of  said “of course the people” — “of course the thing that people ask ‘what keeps you most up at night in the biodefense world’ pandemic flu of course  i think everyone in this room probably shares that concern  your own health and human services secretary was aware that this had the potential of being a very big problem around the world a pandemic of this nature  who dropped the ball the president  well i always knew that pandemics are one of the worst things that could happen  there’s been nothing like this since probably   that was the big one in europe  it started actually here and went to europe  probably  i’ve heard about —    you’ve also said nobody could see this coming the president  excuse me  wait a minute  let me finish  i’ve heard about this for a long time — pandemics  you don’t want pandemics  and i don’t think he was talking about a specific pandemic  he was talking about the threat of a pandemic could happen  and it could happen  most people thought it wouldn’t and most people didn’t understand the severity of it  this is a very severe  what’s happened is very severe  but i’d let you answer that  i assume that he was talking about the concept of a pandemic secretary azar  thank you mr president  actually — absolutely for  years now this country has had a massive effort at the federal state and local level of preparedness for a pandemic  now that largely has been as i said in those remarks about pandemic flu preparedness  we knew about sars we knew about mers which were earlier modifications or variants of the coronavirus  none of those achieved anything like what we’re seeing today but that’s why for successive presidencies including the leadership of president trump there has been a great focus on pandemic preparedness  in fact it was just in november i believe that the president signed the pandemic flu preparedness executive order that we have — and we have also updated the pandemic crisis action plan which has been the playbook from which we’ve been working the pandemic flu plan  again the action plan from which we have been working that coordinates the wholeofgovernment wholeofeconomy approach here so we’ve all been very focused on pandemic preparedness  that’s what we do but this particular strain of pandemic who would — who would have known this particular strain    but secretary azar if you were preparing for a pandemic if this government were preparing for a pandemic why is it we don’t have enough masks  why is it we don’t have enough medical equipment in this country the president  previous administrations gave us very little ammunition for the military and very little shelf space  let me just tell you —    but you’ve been president — the president  you know it —    you’ve been president — the president  you know the answer    — three or four years now the president  the previous administration the shelves were empty  the shelves were empty    you had time to stock the shelves the president  so what you should do is speak to the people from the previous administration jim and ask them that question because —    mr president you’ve been in office — the president  — the shelves were empty    — for almost four years the president  and you know what else  the military shelves were also empty  we had no ammunition literally  and that was said by one of your favorite generals  “we have — sir we have no ammunition  guess what  we had very little medical supply also all right  go ahead please    isn’t that a copout though the president  go ahead    isn’t that a copout the president  we’ll get it back  we’ll get you back    but mr president — the president  we’ll get you back please    but what about that question — the president  jim i said we’ll get you back please go ahead    so i want to ask about the dpa  so you said that there will be a ban on exporting of all — what does it cover  so masks gloves  what else is included in that order the president  it covers everything    and are you concerned — the president  but if somebody ordered — if italy if spain who has big problems — these have — these are countries with tremendous problems — france  if they ordered — if they have longterm orders and they’re in in there and they want to get certain things i’ve let them go out in certain instances because i think it’s only fair  they have problems that are proportionately or relatively bigger than our problems  so if they ordered something and they’re waiting for as an example masks made here and going to italy i’m not going to be stopping that  i think it would be very unfair and by the way speaking about being fair and unfair two very big cruise liners as you know i allowed them to dock today  we worked with the governor of florida as you know ron desantis and we worked on it and we had tremendous security and we took the sick people and we’re working with them  we have doctors  we have great doctors military doctors  and from a humane standpoint not that we’re in love with this — these are two massive ships — but we have to take care of people  we have to take care we sent many back to canada  the canada — the canadians came and worked very closely with us as did the uk  we had a lot of people from the uk  and we take — we took care of the americans  we took care of the sick  we had some people very sick  i think we have three to four maybe five people that had died on the boat  one of the boats actually  and we had to take care of these people so we couldn’t let them float aimlessly into the ocean looking for port as they’ve been doing for a long time  and i made the decision we had to take them in  and homeland security and a lot of other people did a great job but we had to help people  these are people that were very very sick  some were dying  some died please    mr president on dpa — can i just finish please the president  go ahead  yeah  go ahead    mr president your staff they said that people in close proximity to you and the vice president will get a coronavirus test  i’m wondering are you concerned that the people you’ve been hanging around with may have the virus the president  no i’m not concerned  no  i had a test yesterday    but what’s the reason for the order for people who meet with you or talk to you  why should they require coronavirus testing the president  i don’t know  i mean i just — i heard from the oil executives  these are people — most of them had not had the test  and frankly i think they left the room feeling good about a lot of things  but they felt good about the test this was a test that took i guess  minutes to have it finalized  they took the test  i don’t know  i didn’t know they were doing that  maybe they did it just for them  i don’t know  but —    but they’re always going to have to have a test the president  — it seems that a lot of people — because now we have tests that really work well  abbott in this case abbott  we have other tests being developed right now that are also fantastic the original test — the ones we inherited jim as an example they were — they were broken  they were obsolete  they were not good tests  and that’s what we got stuck with  we’ve developed some incredible tests  but this took  to  minutes  and they were all fine    on the dpa sir — the president  go ahead  finish — finish your question    thank you  yeah  so the problem some people have raised is that if the us stopped exporting what you could have is other countries then deciding reciprocally that they are going to stop exporting — the president  sure    — and that the result of that then will be a net decrease in the amount of supplies that american doctors american hospitals have  how do you address that the president  well i address it in the following manner we really are very well supplied  we are not the principal — it’s the hospitals the states the cities  they’re supposed to get everything they can and stock up in case something like this happens  but nobody could ever have assumed that something like this happened so we started supplying we brought tremendous amounts to new york today and over the last few days  we brought them to louisiana  we brought them to michigan  we brought them to los angeles  a lot of equipment  you’ve read the amount of masks that we had  i think i said over  million masks  the  masks  the you know more expensive more complicated better whatever masks — the ones they want to use in the hospitals we have millions of them now and we’ve given them to a lot  we sent to bellevue in new york today — that was for mayor de blasio —  of them  but we have  million we’re going to have more than that  and we’re getting them from various sources including the military  we’re rapidly then replacing them because we have to replace them in case there’s a — another emergency  i would be — gowns too  we have many gowns being delivered and have been delivered our people have done an incredible job  most people have said — now and i said this yesterday — governors have said “thank you very much  great job  if they’re a democrat governor — in some cases not in all cases at all — if i said “here’s  ventilators  how many do you want  “we want   “here’s   you got ’em  but you know what we’re going to do  we’re going to add another   is that good  they said “wow that’s great  and then if jim acosta goes and says “are you happy with the president  “no he should have given us   that’s what’s happening  you know why  because that’s a standard political answer  and that’s a shame because we have done a job like nobody has ever done a job but we’ve just delivered a lot of masks  we’ve just delivered a lot of gowns and protective gear  but you know you’re talking about a massive — you’re talking about a massive number  but as of this morning people were very very happy steve    did oil executives ask you for a bailout of any sort the president  no they didn’t ask for a bailout  no    what did they ask for the president  it was really more of a discussion than asking  we discu — you know we did discuss the concept of tariffs because as you know this was a dispute among a couple of countries that i think they want to be able to get it solved  they had a dispute  they had a competition  but they want to get it resolved russia —    you mean tariffs — tariffs on — the president  — and saudi arabia i think want to get it —    — saudi and russia the president  yeah  i think they want to get it resolved  i think they’re working very hard  i mean they told me they want to get it resolved  they’re working very hard go ahead    president trump thank you  yesterday jared kushner said the notion of the federal stockpile was it’s supposed to be “our” stockpile  it’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use  what did he mean by “our”  and — the president  well why don’t you ask him    and even the fact that taxpayers from every state pays for it — the president  what’s that  a “gotcha”  “i gotcha  you used the word “our”    no it’s not a “gotcha  what did he mean by it the president  “our” — you know what “our” means  united states of america  that’s what it means  it means —   so it means the states the president  our  our  it means the united states of america  and then we take that “our” and we distribute it to the states    so why did he say it’s not supposed — the president  not that we have to —    — to be state stockpiles that they then can use the president  because we need it for the government and we need it for the federal government    to give to the states the president  but when the states are in trouble — no to also keep —    then who are you giving to if it’s not to the states the president  to keep — to keep for our country because the federal government needs it too not just the states  but out of that we oftentimes choose — as an example we have almost  ventilators and we are ready to rock with those ventilators  we’re going to bring them to various areas of the country that need them  but when he says “our” he’s talking about our country  he’s talking —    but he makes the distinction the president  excuse me    and sir — the president  he’s talking about the federal government  i mean it’s such a basic simple question and you try and make it sound so bad    it’s not bad  i’m just trying to — the president  you ought to be — you ought to be ashamed of yourself    — understand  no — by the way secretary azar — the president  you know what  you ought to be ashamed   it’s such a simple question  he said “our  and “our” means for the country and “our” means for the states —    but then he said it’s not supposed to be state stockpiles the president  — because the states are part of the country  don’t make it sound bad  don’t make it sound bad go ahead steve  go ahead back here    but mr president the hhs even changed the language on the website the president  you just asked your question  you just asked your question in a very nasty tone    i don’t think it was nasty the president  let’s go    i think you didn’t give me an answer the president  please    mr president — the president  i gave you a perfect answer  you know it  go ahead    well just to follow up on that when we have the federal stockpile — i mean isn’t that designed to be able to distribute to the states who need it the president  sure  but it’s also needed for the federal government  we have a federal stockpile and they have state stockpiles  and frankly they were — many of the states were totally unprepared for this  so we had to go into the federal stockpile  but we’re not an ordering clerk  they have to have for themselves now some of the states were in good shape  some of the states were not in good shape  that’s probably something you could expect  we have been helping states  we have been spending a tremendous amount of time effort and billions and billions of dollars on making sure that they have what they have i mean take new york we built them hospitals — i built them four hospitals — built them medical centers sent a ship with  rooms and  operating rooms and then on top of that gave vast numbers of ventilators and vast numbers of surgical gowns equipment masks everything else now they had a chance to order ventilators over the years  they had a chance to order a very big — but they didn’t choose to do it  we were there and we helped them  and i think the governor of new york is very thankful for the help that we gave but we have a stockpile  it’s a federal stockpile  we can use that for states or we can use it for ourselves  we do use it for the federal government  we have a very big federal government go ahead    so have you decided not to use your powers to be essentially a traffic cop for all the essential medical supplies that are needed in this the president  well we’re not a traffic cop  we’re a humanitarian cop  we help — it’s like the ships  do you think we wanted to take two big ships into our country that have obvious problems  and you know the problems i’m talking about  so i have a decision to make do i take them in or do i save lives  okay  do i take them in or do i save  i decided to take them in and we have tremendous protection  we have great doctors there to help the people  they had four or five people that died  that was as of last night  they died on the ships  we took care of it  and now the people are in the process of — and many are already back in canada they’re back in the uk — united kingdom  and many of them were american citizens  some were very sick  we’re taking care of the sick people  we’re testing all of the others very very carefully — very very carefully  they are being tested like you wouldn’t believe  and we solve a humanitarian catastrophe  you know why  because nobody else would take the ships  nobody else would take them  so we docked him in i think fort lauderdale    i think some people are wondering why you don’t say “we’re the federal government and there’s a shortage of masks and other things and — the president  we do say that    — we’re going to — the president  we do say that    — sign off on every single shipment– the president  we say we’re — we say and use the act    — that needs to go to places where it needs to go” the president  excuse me we do say that and we use the act  and we’ve used it a number of times very powerfully  and a lot of times we don’t have to use it because we say “we’re going to use it if you don’t do this or that” and then we also have companies that act incredibly well  we have plenty of them — mostly them  but we’ve used the act very powerfully  and a lot of times you don’t have to exercise the act all you have to do is tell them “look if you don’t do this we’re going to use the act” and we’ve done a good job with it — maybe a great job yeah    mr president there are news reports that you want to sign the stimulus checks that are going out here in several months  is that right  do you want to sign those checks the president  no  me sign  no  there’s millions of checks  i’m going to sign them  no  it’s a trump administration initiative  but do i want to sign them  no the people are getting — the people are getting their money  there’s a lot of stimulus going in a lot of different ways  there’s also stimulus going for companies that would — if it weren’t our government would not — and some companies that were very strong a month ago again we had the strongest economy in the world  we had our best ever  we had probably the best economy in the history of the world bigger than china bigger than anybody  and one day we have to say “close it up  stop  everybody go home  and you know what  that’s pretty tough to do that    that’s another thing — that there are rumors that these checks may not go out for another four months like if you don’t have a direct deposit the president  i don’t know  all i can tell you is the small business today is — we’re way ahead of schedule  there is a problem where — and — which i pointed out i said “you shouldn’t do it this way” — with unemployment where  equipment by the states  we’re sending the money to the states  once the money is sent to the states then the states whether they’re republican or democrat have to get the money out to the people  hopefully they’ll be able to do it but many of those states have  computers  i don’t know that they’re equipped  i wanted to give them money direct if that’s what you’re talking about  i wanted to give the money out direct  it would have been much easier  but the democrats and some people said “no let’s do it the complicated way”    i’m talking more about the stimulus checks  the — like — the president  all right well i was talking about —    — when will people get their money the president  excuse me i was talking about both    yeah  when will people get that money the president  yeah they’ll get it  they will go ahead  please    thank you sir  i’d like to ask questions both for myself and some of the other reporters who aren’t in the room social distancing the president  sure    first of all — and this is for yourself and dr birx what percentage of the population do we suspect to be asymptomatic at this point  is there a way to figure that out  it seems like the antibody test might be able to assist in determining that number the president  go ahead deborah dr birx  yeah thank you  so while we’re working diligently in the midst of the crisis to make sure that the healthcare workers and everyone who is sick gets provided for at the same time we’re working on tests and assays that will be critical for surveillance and at the same time working on plans for what we need to do as this moves through the population and we get on the downside where we’re sort of — we’re not there yet  and hopefully most of the states will — say like california and washington  and then what we need to do to be prepared for fall so all three of those things are happening simultaneously and there’s people working on each one of those work streams the antibody piece is critical as you described because at this time we can’t — if we have — let’s say asymptomatic status is inversely — symptomatic status is inversely related to age and so the younger you are the more likely you are to be asymptomatic we have to know that because we have to know how many people have actually become infected so when we talked about five days ago — i think on monday — i called on universities to work on an elisabased test to test for their health workers and really get through that at the same time the private sector is working on tests  and what do we want those tests to be  we want those tests to be like what we use for hiv and malaria — finger prick onto a cassette  you get a line if you’re positive and you get a control line  negative the line isn’t there and there’s the control line  that’s what — that’s our dream assay because it’s a finger prick in the meantime we’re not waiting  i mean we’re pushing for that  at the same time we’re asking to develop an assay — the elisabased assay which requires a tube of blood  and that’s why we’re also talking about could we use dried blood spots we also put out a call directly out to the military because of the roosevelt to really test all of the sailors on the roosevelt with an antibody test to get to this critical issue of asymptomatic and already preexisting antibody  that would be — if the first responders knew they already had had it and they had protective antibody  if the nurses knew the doctors knew if your schoolteacher knew then it’s a very different dialogue  so we understand the importance of that and we understand how important it is in relationship to understanding this epidemic one other comment because i know we’re always saying “who knew what when  i just want to make clear there’s  countries working on this collectively together  it’s devastating for every single country  when we get through this we can go back and look at what happened where and what does this epidemic look like  and when you get through it then you can validate every model there is known to man  when you’re in the middle of it you have to concentrate on serving the needs of each american and what that need looks like at the same time you have these other work streams on surveillance and how to be prepared both scientifically and therapeutically and vaccinewise for the next fall if it happens again so i think these things are happening together but i just want us to really concentrate on the fact that all around the globe country after country is dealing with this  and we can talk about “why didn’t italy do something or spain do something or germany do something  or we can really say “right now we all can we can do something  we can do the social distancing and all of the pieces that we know is starting to work around the globe in country after country and then when we get through all of this we can ask the questions about “could we have done some piece of this better as a global community” i will remind you that on february  the head of the who said there was no reason to ever do a travel ban  you know it wasn’t until january  that we knew that there was humantohuman transmission  remember —    dr birx the president was saying this was going to go away  it’s april the president  it is going to go away  it is going away    the president — but mr president you said it was going to go away in april the president  it’s going — i didn’t say a date    you said “when it warmed up in april…” the president  i said it’s going away and it is going away okay are you —    dr birx — dr birx  yes  thank you sir    but — if i’m — the president  okay that was a good answer to your question  no no no  no no  no more  that was a long but a very good answer  that was enough for you    i have a question on the insurance inaudible coverage  mr president on the insurance coverage for treatment the way your government is going is trying to make sure that people are covered on the treatment for covid — the president yeah we’re going to do that    does that include the  million people who are in this country illegally  are they going to be covered as well the president  we’ll be talking about that at a different time yeah please  go head    yes mr president will you release — authorize the release of the underlying data for the conclusion of the  to  people succumbing  perhaps dr birx can talk — the president  well that’s up to dr birx  you’ll decide as to when — dr birx  we can release all of the — i —    some disease experts have expressed concern that they haven’t seen the underlying data  they’re not questioning — the president  i’m sure they’ll talk to you about that and dr fauci too please go ahead    thank you mr president  this is for you and secretary azar  ten million people say they’ve lost their jobs in the past two weeks  so how is this stimulus money for free treatment going to absorb the new numbers of uninsured and — the president  go ahead if you want — go ahead    — would it not be easier to reopen the obamacare markets or expand medicaid secretary azar  so for an individual who had employer insurance — that’s what i mentioned in my remarks — if you were employed and had insurance through your employer and you’ve now lost your job and lost that insurance you now do have a special enrollment period where you may enroll in the individual exchanges of the affordable care act  so that’s — that’s existing law then what we’re doing is taking from that hundred billion dollars to providers taking money and saying “if you’re a provider and you care for anybody who is uninsured we’re going to compensate you for doing that and we’re going to compensate you at the medicare reimbursement rates and you are not allowed to bill that uninsured individual anything” so in many respects it’s better for those uninsured individuals  they’re going to get firstdollar coverage they’re going to get care in the united states and the provider is going to be made whole from this program  so it’s really an unprecedented — what president trump is doing here with this money is an unprecedented diseasespecific support of care for individuals to make sure that people get treatment    will someone still be billed if they test negative  or what about noncovid conditions    so i just have a couple of questions about supplies — one specifically on new york and the question of ventilators  governor cuomo is saying that new york may be days away from running out of ventilators  can you assure new york that going into next week that they’re going to have the ventilators that they’re going to need the president  no they should’ve had more ventilators at the time  they should have had more ventilators  they were totally under serviced  we are trying to do — we’re doing our best for new york  you know we have — we have states we have a lot of states  we have territories too  but we have a lot of states that have to be taken care of some much more so than others we’ve worked very well with the governor  we happen to think that he’s well served with ventilators  we’re going to find out but we have other states to take care of  we have a big problem in louisiana we have a big problem in michigan we have a big problem in seven other really strong hotspots but we’re doing the best we can  i wish they did the original orders three years ago  they would’ve had all the ventilators they needed  although even then they wouldn’t because if you look at what the original request was from new york it was far greater than anybody ever heard  and we’ve — we’ve supplied a lot  i told you we supplied some just today to new york and we supplied some yesterday to new york city did you have one in the back  yeah please    mr president if i can say — this is why the question about the stockpile that was asked earlier is so important the president  i don’t think that was the question inaudible    no it was a very important question because what jared kushner said yesterday is that the federal stockpile is for use by the federal government not for the states to have access to  so you seem to be saying different  so did jared kushner misspeak yesterday the president  no no he didn’t — he didn’t misspeak    is that federal stockpile available to the states the president  he used the word “our  okay  “our” — “our” is referring to our country    yeah but he said — he said it’s not for the states to use the president  the states to the best of my knowledge and to the best of your knowledge are a part of our country  we are taking what is in the federal stockpile and we are helping states all over the country  but we also want to keep some because when that surge comes when you hit those peaks we’re going to need it  and we have to be able to have the flexibility to take those ventilators and bring them to louisiana new york detroit different places  that’s all    but you will be using them for the states that need them the president  oh of course  we’re not using them anywhere else  we’re not going to be using them jon anywhere else  but we want the flexibility because you know we don’t even know when the surge is coming but it’s coming soon and it’s going to be big and some areas won’t have it some areas will be pleasantly surprised just like we’ve been  you look at the chart  states that i thought would have been maybe a disaster turned out to be — really they’ve done a great job  some states are really troubled but you don’t know  you don’t know  we have great flexibility i would have preferred giving them all out  we’d have nothing  and now when we have a surge we can’t get them back from where we gave them because it’s very tough to take it back  so we have tremendous flexibility  and it could be new york  it could be louisiana  those are two that are really rough  new jersey is very rough  and they’ve done a very good job in new jersey but new jersey is very rough go ahead please in the back    yes the question or — the question is about the cdc guidelines  i know that they changed over time from february and there is — the president the guidelines relative to which — the masks    for instance social distancing and the number of people who can gather in a group and so on  and now we have this — this measure about wearing masks  and i know you told steve about why you don’t want to wear a mask but i’m just wondering if you can tell us more about why because it would set — the president  i’m just don’t choose to    — an example the president  they’re not mandatory guidelines they’re guidelines  they suggest you could wear them  you don’t have to wear them  in fact the director is here  if you want to say a couple of words about it  you don’t — you can if you want  you don’t have to    but what i’m really inaudible your decision not to wear one the president  but basically it’s — it’s a voluntary thing  say it director  he’s doing a good job dr redfield  thank you very much  i think i just want to reemphasize — i’ve said this before — that we’re not defenseless against this virus  we have a powerful tool a powerful weapon that is social distancing  and we’ve continued to embrace that with the president’s initiatives to slow the spread of coronavirus we’re constantly looking at new data  and as the surgeon general said one of the new information that became more clear to all of us is there’s a greater number of people that are asymptomatically infected than we previously thought  as ambassador birx said that may be inversely related to age  and so really the purpose here is first and foremost to embrace the social distancing  that’s the number one thing  that’s the powerful weapon and you know this virus has a great weakness it can’t jump from one person to another if it’s got to swim more than six feet  and this is why we really want that  that said we now know that there may be individuals in signif — areas of significant community transmission that may be asymptomatically infected  and we know that a face barrier can actually interrupt the number of virus particles that can go from one person to the other so as was said by the vice president this is — and the president — the purpose of this face covering is to be another adjunctive mitigation strategy to protect someone from spreading the virus from themselves to someone else the president  and i was just tested also  so i assume i don’t know have the virus so i don’t have to worry about spreading it  okay please go ahead    mr president i want to make sure we’re clear  when you mentioned tariffs earlier — the president  yeah    — that came up in a meeting are you considering tariffs on saudi arabian oil  and then also — the president  well i can always consider — look tariffs have made a tremendous amount of money for our country  i put them on china i put them on other places and other countries tariff us and they take advantage of us and they have for many years look countries have taken advantage of the united states for years  they’ve ripped us off like nobody can even believe whether it be on — on manufacturing whether it be on exporting whether it be on almost anything including military where we provide virtually free military assistance to countries that frankly take advantage of us don’t even like us  okay so this has been going on for years they tariff us  they create artificial — you could say nonfinancial barriers which are worse than financial barriers  you can’t sell your product you can’t take care of our farmers they won’t take our — and yet they’ll take us and sell into us and we won’t charge them anything for doing it  look they’ve taken advantage of us for years tariffs are a way of evening the score  tariffs are a way of just neutralizing  they have tariffs on us  and we now can put tariffs on them  am i using it for oil  it’s something we can  no — am i doing it now  no  am i thinking about imposing it as of this moment  no  but if we’re not treated fairly it’s certainly a tool in the toolbox    and what about with russia  are you — would you consider maybe lifting sanctions or giving some sanctions relief if they — the president  well it would be the same thing  no it would be the same thing  they are having a dispute — the two countries — and it’s hurting the rest of the world because it’s really hurting the energy industry  russia is being hurt unbelievably badly and saudi arabia is being hurt unbelievably badly  because oil and gas is a primary — that’s where they get most of their income  and this is a price like from the  all right  it’s a price from the   they are being hurt very badly  i think they’re going to settle their dispute pretty quickly    why — on the oil why do you think you haven’t been more successful on getting them to raise the price the president  go ahead please    why — why do you think you haven’t been more successful in getting them to increase production in russia and saudi arabia if inaudible the president  well they have increased production  that’s what they’ve done  they’ve increased it so much that there’s so — you meant the opposite the president  i meant — yeah  why do you think you haven’t been successful in inaudible increase production the president  yeah  look look just so — well they’re going to stop because the market  ultimately the market is going to get them to stop  but they both did the opposite  they increased production to a level that water is right now more valuable than oil  who would have ever thought right    you have relationships with — the president  you go to — you go to some of these kingdoms water is far more valuable than oil  there’s so much oil  it’s a tribute in a way    inaudible the president  but what happened is there was a lot to start off with and then you had the virus and it knocked the hell out of the market it — in terms of demand  so there’s no demand and there’s tremendous supply so i mean you saw numbers where it was down to  and down frankly below   it was even below   it’s an incredible thing the market  but ultimately the marketplace will take care of it  but i think they’re going to work out their problem fairly quickly okay go ahead    mr president — thank you mr president  we’re already talking about phase four of a stimulus right  but you and pelosi and mcconnell are already talking about different things that should be in it  now last time people were telling me that the fact that you wouldn’t talk to pelosi was an impediment and it really slowed things down  are you — the president  i’d talk — if it were important to talk to her i’d talk to her    are you going to talk to her during the — the president  if it were important for the american people i’d talk to her  but other than that i can have other people talking to her look you ready  infrastructure is a great thing for me  i think infrastructure for this country — we have an old broken infrastructure  fifty years ago we were the envy of the world  and then we spent all this money so stupidly in the middle east  we spent — it’s going to be very close to  trillion in the middle east  how stupid was that decision  but they spent it on that and other things we’ve got to fix our infrastructure    but pelosi is already downplaying — the president  that means roads highways tunnels airports everything  we got to fix our infra —    but pelosi is already kind of downplaying — the president  and the beauty is because of the fact that we are so strong as a country we’re borrowing at zero  we never had a chance to borrow at zero  even in this country we’d never had a chance to borrow at zero  we’re going borrow — this is a great time so we can fix our infrastructure and we’ll have almost no interest costs  this is the time to do it steve one more question    the death total projection that you shared with us earlier this week are we still on the current trajectory for that  or have social distancing — the president  which trajec — which one  i have many trajectories for many things    the  —  to   to   are we still on that trajectory or have we made any improvements  or maybe not enough time has passed the president  say — say it  say it steve  what    have we made enough improvements the president  on what  on what    on social distancing    have the models changed  have the models changed the president  i’d have to ask dr fauci and i’d have — have to ask deborah  have the models changed dr birx  so a lot of the projections you can see are based on — there’s many different ways to look at this  and as we discussed on sunday some of it is based on the current global experience  we are about i think  or  times the size of italy a different factor in spain  and we look at all of those — what their projections are where they are currently and where that is going  and so a lot of the work is based on how this virus has moved through other populations  that’s a very direct way to see how the virus is impacting a population there’s also terrific models  and so every day and every night one of the models that actually looks at the model related to mortality is the healthdataorg data  and they update it every night and you can see where we are in that projection  i think in the last run of that model they were at  or something in the model now all of that can be changed by our behaviors  and so — and all of it can be changed in a different way if we don’t follow those behaviors  if another major metropolitan area ends up having an epidemic like the new york metro area that could dramatically change not the model but the reality of the impact of this virus on americans    and where are the models on — the president  and by the way the models show hundreds of thousands of people are going to die  you know what i want to do  i want to come away under the models  the professionals did the models  i was never involved in a model but — at least this kind of a model  but you know what  hundreds of thousands of people they say are going to die  i want much less than that  i want none but it’s too late for that  but i want very few people relative to what the models are saying those are projections  i hope they’re wrong  i hope we’re going to be under those projections    mr president two questions on continuity of government  for — the president  how come you always have two  why can’t you have one    well they’re related the president  every time “i have three questions  i have two questions  can you give me one instead  because we have a couple of other people  go ahead    okay i’ll go with my second one  the governor of wisconsin is now talking about delaying the primary at least not having inperson voting  so my question is — and i asked this a couple weeks ago i want to see if you’ve made any progress on this  looking ahead to the fall are you taking steps to ensure that the general election will happen even if this pandemic has reemerged or hasn’t gone away  and — the president  the general election will happen on november     and do you — are you — the president  in wisconsin what happened is i through social media — media put out a very strong endorsement of a republican conservative judge who’s an excellent brilliant judge  he’s a justice and i hear what happened is his poll numbers went through the roof  and because of that i think they delayed the election    you don’t think the governor is concerned about people going to inperson voting the president  i don’t know  why didn’t he do it before  he was doing right before the election    but do you think every — the president  excuse me  why didn’t he do this two weeks ago  all of a sudden —    but isn’t it — because of the pandemic the president  excuse me  all of a sudden an election which is taking place very soon gets delayed  now i just endorsed him today and it was a very strong endorsement  his polls — he’s gone very high up  and all of a sudden the governor comes out — the democrat governor by the way — comes out and says “oh we’re going to move this election  so i don’t know  i’m sure — i hope you’re right  i hope you’re right    but — but do you think every state in this country should be prepared for mailin voting in case we’re in a situation — the president  no because i think a lot of people cheat with mailin voting  i think people should vote with id — voter id  i think voter id is very important  and the reason they don’t want voter id is because they intend to cheat when you get something when you buy something you look at your cards and credit cards and different cards — you have your picture on many of them  not all of them but on many of them  you should have a picture on your — on your — for voting  it should be called “voter id  they should have that  and it shouldn’t be mailin —    but how are you going to — the president  excuse me  it shouldn’t be mailin voting  it should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself  you don’t send it in the mail where people pick up — all sorts of bad things can happen by the time they signed that if they sign that — if they signed that by the time it gets in and is tabulated no it shouldn’t be mailed in  you should vote at the booth  and you should have voter id because when you have voter id that’s the real deal thank you very much  we’ll see you tomorrow en            pm edt</td>\n",

bank of america had more than loan in two hour and for anybody who ’ s in small business — my first small business wa when i wa year old you don ’ t have income coming in right now you get a loan but for your rent paying your employee and paying your utility is a grant that ’ s part of the care act and i think you ’ re going to find that a lot of small business are going to hire people back keep

leader mccarthy thank you the president thank you you go ahead i ’ ll talk to you later okay thank you very much everybody and i want to start by saying that our heart go out to the people of new york a they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in america that seems to be the hotspot right now but you have some others a you know that are very — very bad very bad louisiana is getting hit very hard part of michigan are getting hit very very hard new jersey is — is –surprisingly it ’ s much greater than anybody would have thought they ’ re doing a really good job the governor is doing a really good job out there new york ’ s first responder emts doctor nurse are showing incredible courage under pressure they ’ re the best in the world we will take every action and we ’ ll spare no resource — financial medical scientific we will not spare anything we ’ ll get it back into shape the empire state — the governor is doing an excellent job they ’ re all working very hard together at the request of the governor a you know the javits center we have bed and we ’ re going to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be looked after the patient can be looked after that wa going to be for regular medical problem such a accident and you know it ’ s very interesting the governor is telling me we don ’ t have too many accident and very few people driving so we ’ re going to put that facility into play which is a big facility the ship will be staying the way it is but we ’ re putting that facility into play to help them and today also the cdc is announcing additional step american can take to defend against the transmission of the virus from recent study we know that the transmission from individual without symptom is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood so you don ’ t seem to have symptom and it still get transferred in light of these study the cdc is advising the use of nonmedical cloth face covering a an additional voluntary public health measure so it ’ s voluntary you don ’ t have to do it they suggested for a period of time but this is voluntary i don ’ t think i ’ m going to be doing it but you have a lot of way — you can look at it a follows the cdc is recommending that american wear a basic cloth or a fabric mask that can be either purchased online or simply made at home probably material that you ’ d have at home these face covering can be easily washed or reused i want to emphasize that the cdc is not recommending the use of medicalgrade or surgicalgrade mask and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard and doing some job medical protective gear must be reserved for the frontline healthcare worker who are performing those vital service the new mask guideline also do not replace cdc ’ s guidance on social distancing including staying in your home when possible standing at least six foot apart for a period of time again we ’ re going to all come back together here we ’ re going to all come back together and practicing hand hygiene which we should do anyway a lot of thing i think are going to spill over shaking hand maybe will stay with our country for a long time beyond this one of the — one of our great doctor wa telling me that — a you know we have flu every year and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial and said that if they didn ’ t shake hand that number would be substantially lower so maybe it ’ ll stay maybe some of these thing long term will be good but those guideline are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection so with the mask it ’ s going to be really a voluntary thing you can do it you don ’ t have to do it i ’ m choosing not to do it but some people may want to do it and that ’ s okay it may be good probably will they ’ re making a recommendation it ’ s only a recommendation it ’ s voluntary we ’ re also taking action to ensure the cost of no barrier to any american seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus the largest insurer nationwide the bluecross blueshield system ha now announced that it will not require any copays — which is really something that ’ s a tremendous statement — from patient of the virus treatment for the next day similar to the commitment of cigna humana anthem those are great company and they ’ re all doing the same thing so copays for them to do that is — it ’ s a big statement we appreciate it today i can so proudly announce that hospital and healthcare provider treating uninsured coronavirus patient will be reimbursed by the federal government using fund from the economic relief package congress passed last month so that wa a per the question yesterday and actually the day before yesterday this should alleviate any concern uninsured american may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment so that ’ s i think answer the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people i ’ m also signing a directive invoking the defense production act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supply by unscrupulous actor and profiteer the security and secretary — the secretary of homeland security will work with fema to prevent the export of respirator surgical mask glove and other personal protective equipment we need these item immediately for domestic use we have to have them but we ’ ve done really well with the purchase of item and you ’ ll be hearing about that shortly we ’ ve already leveraged the dpa to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supply under that authority this week the department of health and human service working with the department of justice took custody of nearly respirator surgical mask glove a well a bottle — many many many bottle — and disinfectant spray that were being hoarded all of this material is now being given to healthcare worker most of it ha already been given out and we ’ ve given a lot to new york a lot in new jersey a lot to other place in addition to ensure that healthcare worker in new york have the protective equipment they need the federal government in the name of the department of defense is providing about million respirator department of defense and we ’ ve already given of them to new york city mayor de blasio needed them very badly so we got them to mayor de blasio in new york city and they were very grateful million and we ’ re going to be increasing that number from million to more that ’ s a lot of respirator today my team spoke with the ceo of ochsner health and the ceo of lcmc the two largest health system in new orleans they said they feel that they currently have enough ventilator — i think a lot of people are going to have enough ventilator — and mask and appreciate what we did and all of the thing we ’ ve been doing with them working with them the ceo of ochsner warner thomas — who ’ s really been fantastic i have to say — indicated a need for surgical gown and i instructed fema to deliver them tomorrow so they ’ ll have the that ’ s louisiana — new orleans two hundred and thirty thousand surgical gown they ’ ll have them by tomorrow we ’ re expanding the role of the armed force in our response effort because no one is better prepared to win a war than the united state military and we are in a war the invisible enemy — remember over retired army medical personnel have answered their nation ’ s call and are now supporting field hospital and medical facility all across the country like what i just told you that governor cuomo requested we do something in javits where we take it over and we ’ re going to have that manned by the military because it ’ s very tough to get people — more people in the new york area so we ’ re going to have it manned by the military — javits center national guard member have been activated to help state build new treatment center and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supply that includes national guard the national guard is assisting very strongly because the state were in many case unable to have the delivery capability from warehouse and other place that we put the supply so i ’ ve given approval to use the national guard — the various national guard in the different state and they ’ re doing a fantastic job of not only protecting people but delivering material the army corp of engineer ha assessed more than facility in all state and is rapidly building temporary hospital and alternative care site in many state in new york new jersey michigan pennsylvania arizona california colorado florida illinois new mexico oregon washington wisconsin ohio they ’ re doing a lot of work in just those state plus additionals that are being — will be announced probably tomorrow but they ’ re doing some job the army corp of engineer — what a job they ’ re doing and fema — what a job they ’ re doing a we deploy the power of our military we ’ re also deploying the skill of our doctor scientist and medical researcher we continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapy and the treatment and prevention of the virus and we will keep the american people fully informed on our finding hydroxychloroquine — i don ’ t know it ’ s looking like it ’ s having some good result i hope that — that would be a phenomenal thing but we have it right now in — approximately now it ’ s increased to people i spoke with dr zucker in new york — terrific guy by the way he ’ s — we ’ re doing a good job and i spoke to governor cuomo last evening and this morning about it so it ’ s been there for about three and a half day but i think — and many other place it ’ s being tested too and we have a tremendous supply of it we ’ ve ordered it in the case that it work and it ’ s — it could have some pretty big impact and we ’ ll see what happens my administration is also working to get relief to american worker and business on day one of the paycheck protection program a kevin said more than billion in guaranteed loan have been processed to help small business keep their worker employed during the unprecedented time — this unprecedented time and bank of america ha been incredible of the big bank bank of america ha really stepped forward and done a great job and then you have the community bank your smaller bank and we ’ re already at billion going out to incredible people but that ’ s way ahead of schedule the sba and the treasury are working around the clock and our banking partner are really incredible and they ’ re ensuring that the money get to small business a quickly a possible and then the small business in turn take care of employee that they would have had to let go and now they ’ ll keep them and that ’ s good and then they ’ re going to open for business and they ’ re going to have their employee and we ’ ll try and get back to where we were eventually we ’ re going to supersede where we were the energy industry ha been especially hard hit in the crisis this afternoon i met with greg garland of phillips dave hager of devon energy harold hamm of continental resource jeff hildebrand of hilcorp energy vicki hollub of occidental petroleum mike sommers of the american petroleum institute kelcy warren of energy transfer partner mike wirth of chevron and darren wood of exxon mobil i informed them that we will be making space available in the strategic petroleum reserve to let american producer store surplus oil that can be sold at a later time there ’ s a tremendous abundance of oil primarily because of the virus the virus ha just stopped demand of everything including oil so we ’ re working with our great energy company these are great company they employ ten of thousand hundred of thousand of people and they ’ ve kept america really going for a long time and no big price hike no big anything i mean they ’ ve just kept it going and now they got hit but with all the job and all of the good that they do we ’ re going to make sure that they stay in good shape america is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the life of our citizen our future society our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time and we want them to stay healthy for a long time so stay at home this is ending this will end you ’ ll see some bad thing and then you ’ re going to see some really good thing and it ’ s not going to be too long we will heal our citizen and we will care for our neighbor and we will unleash the full might of the united state of america to vanquish the virus and with that i ’ d like to ask mike penny to come up vice president and say a few word and we ’ ll have a couple of other quick talk on a couple of subject and we ’ ll take question and it ’ s a beautiful friday in washington dc and our country is a great place and we ’ re getting better we ’ re getting better very quickly this wa artificially induced we just said — they said “ close it down you have to close it down we closed it down and we ’ re healing we ’ re going to get it better fast so mike if you could come up say a few word please the vice president thank you mr president the president just outlined a number of the decision that he made today on the unanimous recommendation to the white house coronavirus task force in addition some good news dr deborah birx will reflect on in a moment and some of the area across america where we see evidence that the mitigation effort — the american people putting into practice the president ’ s coronavirus guideline — are having a positive effect in fact today california and washington state where the coronavirus first emerged in our country remain — the case remain at a steady but low rate and we know a governor newsom said yesterday that they ’ re not out of the wood yet we continue to flow resource but we want to commend people in those state and all across the country who are putting into practice the social distancing and all the measure that state and local leader are advising and that — and that the president ha been advising in the coronavirus guideline for america we ’ re also continuing to track significant outbreak in new york state new orleans detroit chicago and boston and a the president indicated we ’ re prioritizing resource to support healthcare worker and to support those that are dealing with the coronavirus in those community on the subject of testing now more than million test have been performed across the country and a you all are aware some american have tested positive for the coronavirus abbott instrument which now can perform a test across the country have literally of their machine across the nation today but at the president ’ s direction fema is acquiring over more machine to distribute to every state public health lab in america and also to our indian healthcare service and the big news of course over the last few day wa that the fda — once again in near record time — ha approved an antibody test developed by cellex and we ’ re continuing on the white house coronavirus task force to examine way that we can scale up these rapid test and these innovative new test not just to meet this moment but to lay a foundation for testing across the nation in the month ahead a the president mentioned he met with energy executive today and continues to engage with leader of business all across the nation we also have held a teleconference today with commercial retailer on the president ’ s behalf we thanked them for the way that people that operate mall and shopping center around the country have embraced and enacted the coronavirus guideline for america it ’ s had enormous impact on their business and their industry but i heard — i heard from them their — their patriotic commitment to put the health of their associate and their customer first and it wa deeply inspiring on the subject of supply the president detailed our work in that space it continues to this day a part of our air bridge we had a flight arrive from china today to columbus ohio we continue to work each and every day watching the data about case to ensure that in particular not just the personal protective equipment is available for the healthcare worker that are on the frontlines but also that ventilator are available a the — a this epidemic make it way through region and community we are literally working hour by hour day by day to make sure that patient family and healthcare provider have the equipment and the support that they need a the president mentioned we ’ ve seen over a billion and a half dollar in loan go out through the paycheck protection program today we have available for question the head of the cdc today to speak about the new guidance on cloth face covering and secretary azar in a few moment will explain just how the president ’ s decision to make sure that no american will ever have to worry about paying for testing or for coronavirus treatment i ’ m pleased to report at the president ’ s direction medicaid and medicare already expanded to coronavirus treatment and testing early on and of course the president just indicated how major insurance company across the country are not just waiving copays on testing but they ’ re now waiving copays for at least day on any coronavirus treatment but now a secretary azar will enumerate now we ’ ll make sure that any american even those that have no insurance will be able to receive treatment in a hospital and never have to worry about the bill i ’ ll just give a general reminder to every american there is evidence across the country that you ’ re putting into practice the coronavirus guideline for america every american ha a role to play and i want to thank you on behalf of the president and all of the american people for the way that you ’ re stepping forward you ’ re engaging in the social distancing and doing the thing that will slow the spread we encourage you to keep on keeping on and we will get through this america we will get through the coronavirus to that day of renewed health and renewed prosperity that the president always describes but we ’ ll get through there sooner and we ’ ll get through there when we work together dr birx dr birx thank you mr vice president mr president thank you for your word of discipline and determination i guess that really describes what we ’ re asking every american to really be disciplined about these guideline and really determined to stay in that space of execution you know we are just in week three on — of this full guidance measure we really do appreciate the work of the citizen of california and washington state because we do see that their curve is different their curve is different from new york new jersey and connecticut and we really believe that the work that every citizen is doing in those state is making a difference and it will make a difference for the frontline healthcare provider we also are deeply grateful despite the way their curve look today they continue to get ready for a different potential so that they can ensure that patient if they do get sick have option and availability to all the frontline healthcare worker in the — what we have referred to a “ hot zone ” — area where the number of case are quite significant — the new orleans the new york city metro area including new jersey and connecticut — the incredible work that the frontline healthcare worker are providing we ’ re really working now at a much more granular level talking directly to hospital to ensure that they have the supply that they need in coordination with state and local government and to work — i think we discussed it yesterday but i think it wa quite clear also — and reiterated by governor cuomo today — that we have to support one another a each of these different metro area and other area move through their peak of new infection when we talked about it at the beginning of this week we talked about this week and next week being incredibly difficult and we want to recognize the number of american who have lost their life to this virus and recognize the sacrifice that healthcare provider are making both in their care but i think i ’ m very uplifted by hearing their message to family and their compassion for others to provide that kind of support to the individual in the hospital we continue to watch in addition the chicago area the detroit area and have some developing concern around colorado the district of columbia and pennsylvania so a you can see each of these will follow their own curve we ’ ll be getting more and more of those case over time information in a very granular way to each and every one of you so that we can follow these epidemiologic curve a each of these state county and community move through this together in solidarity and really ensuring that we can move supply creatively around the country to meet the need of both the frontline healthcare provider but also every american who need our support right now thank you the president thank you very much secretary azar well thank you mr president for your continued leadership a we battle the coronavirus first i want to thank all of the member of the hhs team and the frontline healthcare worker across america including those who — those service worker who serve in our hospital at our healthcare facility those who clean those who deliver those who stock the shelf — all those who are going into battle every day against the virus your country ha asked you to serve a never before and you have responded heroically i ’ m going to provide a brief update on the administration ’ s plan to cover the testing and treatment for the uninsured getting the uninsured access to the care they need is a top priority for president trump we are already rolling out the billion in funding from the family first coronavirus response act to cover provider ’ expense for testing and diagnosing the uninsured the care act signed by the president includes another billion for healthcare provider under the president ’ s direction we will use a portion of that funding to cover provider ’ cost of delivering care for the uninsured sending the money to provider through the same mechanism used for testing a a condition of receiving fund under this program provider will be forbidden from balance billing the uninsured for the cost of their care provider will be reimbursed at medicare rate we will soon have more specific on how the rest of the billion will go to provider we ’ re working to ensure that this funding is distributed in a way that is fast fair simple and transparent i ’ d also like to remind people that if you ’ ve lost employer insurance coverage you have insurance option that you should look into you ’ d be eligible for a special enrollment period on the healthcare exchange and depending on your state you may be eligible for medicaid just a president trump is working to ensure that treatment is paid for he ’ s working to support new treatment option for patient thanks to the president ’ s leadership many provider are trying different experimental therapy and we need a much data a we can collect a quickly a possible on how these treatment are working today oracle ha developed and is donating to the government and the american people a web portal and platform to gather crowdsourced realtime information from provider about how patient respond to potential therapeutic while this doesn ’ t replace the important work of clinical trial it give u data rapidly if you are a doctor or a healthcare provider and you would like to help u you can sign up today to begin reporting on your work there ’ s a special registration page for provider at thank you very much the president thank you very much okay let ’ s go steve if we could draw you out a little bit more on the advice on face mask what do — what would people gain from wearing a mask and why are you opposed to wearing one yourself the president well i just don ’ t want to wear one myself it ’ s a recommendation they recommend it i ’ m feeling good i just don ’ t want to be doing — i don ’ t know somehow sitting in the oval office behind that beautiful resolute desk — the great resolute desk — i think wearing a face mask a i greet president prime minister dictator king queen i don ’ t know somehow i don ’ t see it for myself i just — i just don ’ t maybe i ’ ll change my mind but this will pas and hopefully it ’ ll pas very quickly now with that being said if somebody want to — i mean most people can just make something out of a certain material so it ’ s very well designated it ’ s very simple to do i won ’ t be doing it personally it ’ s a recommendation okay and would you like to say something about that surgeon general adam sure absolutely the president surgeon general please surgeon general adam well thank you mr president mr vice president mr secretary and cdc director redfield i especially want to thank the folk at the cdc and it ’ s a great question that you ask it ’ s a fair question that you ask i want to unpack the evolution of our guidance on mask because it ha been confusing to the american people first of all i want people to understand that the cdc the world health organization my office and most public health and health organization and professional originally recommended against the general public wearing mask because based on the best evidence available at the time it wa not deemed that that would have a significant impact on whether or not a healthy person wearing a mask would contract we have always recommended that symptomatic people wear a mask because if you ’ re coughing if you have a fever if you ’ re symptomatic you could transmit disease to other people what ha changed in our recommendation well it ’ s important to know that we now know from recent study that a significant portion of individual with coronavirus lack symptom they ’ re what we call asymptomatic and that even those who eventually become presymptomatic meaning that they will develop symptom in the future can transmit the virus to others before they show symptom this mean that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity for example coughing speaking or sneezing even if those people were not exhibiting symptom in light of this new evidence cdc recommends and the task force recommends wearing cloth face covering in public setting where other social distancing measure are difficult to maintain these include place like grocery store and pharmacy we especially recommend this in area of significant communitybased transmission it is critical and the president mentioned this the vice president mentioned this it ’ s critical to emphasize that maintaining six foot of social distancing remains key to slowing the spread of the virus but cdc is additionally advising the use of simple cloth covering to slow the spread of the virus and to help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others the cloth face covering recommended are not surgical mask or respirator those are critical supply that must continue to be reserved for healthcare worker and other medical first responder a recommended by the current cdc guidance a the president also mentioned cloth face covering fashioned from household item or made at home from common material at low cost can be used a an additional voluntary public health measure this recommendation complement and doe not replace the president ’ s coronavirus guideline for america “ day to slow the spread ” which remains the cornerstone of our national effort to slow the spread of the virus cdc is always — always looking at the data we told you that from the beginning — dr birx say it every single press conference — we ’ re looking at the data we ’ re evolving our recommendation and new recommendation will come a the evidence dictate so i want to say if you do choose to wear a face mask — very important — wash your hand first because you don ’ t want to put on a face covering with a dirty hand do not touch your face while you are wearing the face covering because again you could take material from the surface germ from the surface and bring it to your face if you choose to wear a face covering please — please leave the mask the medical supply for the medical professional healthcare worker and frontline worker know that this is not a substitute for social distancing and remember this is all about me protecting you and you protecting me this is about u coming together a community and if people voluntarily choose to wear a face covering they ’ re wearing it to protect their neighbor from getting the coronavirus because again they could have asymptomatic spread so mr president thank you very much for that the president thank you thank you surgeon general adam appreciate the opportunity to update everyone the president great job thank you okay jon mr president dr fauci last night recommended — said that every state should have stayathome order right now do you agree with that should every state in this country have the kind of stayathome order that we now see in place like washington and new york the president i leave it up to the governor the governor know what they ’ re doing they ’ ve been doing a great job i guess we ’ re close to percent anyway and the state that we ’ re talking about are not in jeopardy no i would leave it to the governor i like — i like that from the standpoint of governing and i like that from the standpoint of even our constitution please mr president to address the shortage in the blood supply the food and drug administration announced yesterday — the president well i pointed to him right thanks mr president the president i knew we inaudible i heard a different voice i heard a different voice go ahead we ’ ll get you later going to the oil meeting previously — the president yeah — is the u willing to cut domestic oil production what came out of the meeting what wa the consensus the president well a lot of thing came out it ’ s a great industry it ’ s an important industry it ’ s a tremendous jobproducing industry and it ’ s just vital and it wa also very interesting because they all were given the test before they came into the room so you have the head of exxon mobil you have all these guy taking the test and they all passed with flying color so that wa good they left happy in that respect at least there ’ s just an overabundance of oil right now — oil and gas tremendous overabundance and it wa caused — they were doing a great job they were producing a lot of energy but then you have the virus come along and it knocked another percent maybe percent off of the market so there ’ s too much oil there ’ s a glut and these are great company and they ’ ll figure it out it ’ s free market we ’ ll figure it out you spoke to president putin i mean what ’ s on the table here with him — the president and with the crown prince both yeah the president they were having a competition we ’ ll see how it all work out i think it ’ s going to work out very well it ’ s going to take a long time to — to get rid of that there ’ s massive excess amount of oil and gas massive like probably there ’ s never been so where that doe work out well i guess you could say is for driver i think in certain location it ’ s down to and cent a gallon right now on the road but we have a tremendous industry a great industry a tremendously important industry from the standpoint of job and we ’ re energy independent we have to make sure we keep it that way all right please go ahead mr president a i wa saying the food and drug administration to address the shortage of blood supply announced yesterday it would ease the restriction on certain donor including gay men who are now required to be abstinent for month a opposed to month to donate did you have a hand in that change the president no i didn ’ t know anything about that that wa done by the fda — very capable people at the fda please go ahead yes mr president both the government of canada and are pushing back on this dpa not to export respirator the president yeah say — the president i don ’ t blame them they can push back if they want yeah but they ’ re saying — the president we ’ re not happy with we ’ re not happy and the people that dealt with it directly are not at all happy with so we ’ ll see whether or not we do i heard what he had to say today i don ’ t know the gentleman but we ’ re not happy with go ahead and where is dr fauci the president i don ’ t know but every time you ask that question — whenever he ’ s not here you look you say “ where is he and you ’ ll say “ is there a problem no problem whatsoever every time he ’ s not here — sometimes i ’ ll ask him to come because that ’ s the first question that you and a couple of others from the fake news establishment ask is “ where is dr fauci we ’ re doing great together a different subject if i may ask the president except we ’ re covering a different subject today go ahead a different subject if i may ask the president go ahead jim try another one mr president you have you have said nobody could have seen this pandemic coming but in fact secretary azar at a biodefense summit in april of said “ of course the people ” — “ of course the thing that people ask ‘ what keep you most up at night in the biodefense world ’ pandemic flu of course i think everyone in this room probably share that concern your own health and human service secretary wa aware that this had the potential of being a very big problem around the world a pandemic of this nature who dropped the ball the president well i always knew that pandemic are one of the worst thing that could happen there ’ s been nothing like this since probably that wa the big one in europe it started actually here and went to europe probably i ’ ve heard about — you ’ ve also said nobody could see this coming the president excuse me wait a minute let me finish i ’ ve heard about this for a long time — pandemic you don ’ t want pandemic and i don ’ t think he wa talking about a specific pandemic he wa talking about the threat of a pandemic could happen and it could happen most people thought it wouldn ’ t and most people didn ’ t understand the severity of it this is a very severe what ’ s happened is very severe but i ’ d let you answer that i assume that he wa talking about the concept of a pandemic secretary azar thank you mr president actually — absolutely for year now this country ha had a massive effort at the federal state and local level of preparedness for a pandemic now that largely ha been a i said in those remark about pandemic flu preparedness we knew about sars we knew about mers which were earlier modification or variant of the coronavirus none of those achieved anything like what we ’ re seeing today but that ’ s why for successive presidency including the leadership of president trump there ha been a great focus on pandemic preparedness in fact it wa just in november i believe that the president signed the pandemic flu preparedness executive order that we have — and we have also updated the pandemic crisis action plan which ha been the playbook from which we ’ ve been working the pandemic flu plan again the action plan from which we have been working that coordinate the wholeofgovernment wholeofeconomy approach here so we ’ ve all been very focused on pandemic preparedness that ’ s what we do but this particular strain of pandemic who would — who would have known this particular strain but secretary azar if you were preparing for a pandemic if this government were preparing for a pandemic why is it we don ’ t have enough mask why is it we don ’ t have enough medical equipment in this country the president previous administration gave u very little ammunition for the military and very little shelf space let me just tell you — but you ’ ve been president — the president you know it — you ’ ve been president — the president you know the answer — three or four year now the president the previous administration the shelf were empty the shelf were empty you had time to stock the shelf the president so what you should do is speak to the people from the previous administration jim and ask them that question because — mr president you ’ ve been in office — the president — the shelf were empty — for almost four year the president and you know what else the military shelf were also empty we had no ammunition literally and that wa said by one of your favorite general “ we have — sir we have no ammunition guess what we had very little medical supply also all right go ahead please isn ’ t that a copout though the president go ahead isn ’ t that a copout the president we ’ ll get it back we ’ ll get you back but mr president — the president we ’ ll get you back please but what about that question — the president jim i said we ’ ll get you back please go ahead so i want to ask about the dpa so you said that there will be a ban on exporting of all — what doe it cover so mask glove what else is included in that order the president it cover everything and are you concerned — the president but if somebody ordered — if italy if spain who ha big problem — these have — these are country with tremendous problem — france if they ordered — if they have longterm order and they ’ re in in there and they want to get certain thing i ’ ve let them go out in certain instance because i think it ’ s only fair they have problem that are proportionately or relatively bigger than our problem so if they ordered something and they ’ re waiting for a an example mask made here and going to italy i ’ m not going to be stopping that i think it would be very unfair and by the way speaking about being fair and unfair two very big cruise liner a you know i allowed them to dock today we worked with the governor of florida a you know ron desantis and we worked on it and we had tremendous security and we took the sick people and we ’ re working with them we have doctor we have great doctor military doctor and from a humane standpoint not that we ’ re in love with this — these are two massive ship — but we have to take care of people we have to take care we sent many back to canada the canada — the canadian came and worked very closely with u a did the uk we had a lot of people from the uk and we take — we took care of the american we took care of the sick we had some people very sick i think we have three to four maybe five people that had died on the boat one of the boat actually and we had to take care of these people so we couldn ’ t let them float aimlessly into the ocean looking for port a they ’ ve been doing for a long time and i made the decision we had to take them in and homeland security and a lot of other people did a great job but we had to help people these are people that were very very sick some were dying some died please mr president on dpa — can i just finish please the president go ahead yeah go ahead mr president your staff they said that people in close proximity to you and the vice president will get a coronavirus test i ’ m wondering are you concerned that the people you ’ ve been hanging around with may have the virus the president no i ’ m not concerned no i had a test yesterday but what ’ s the reason for the order for people who meet with you or talk to you why should they require coronavirus testing the president i don ’ t know i mean i just — i heard from the oil executive these are people — most of them had not had the test and frankly i think they left the room feeling good about a lot of thing but they felt good about the test this wa a test that took i guess minute to have it finalized they took the test i don ’ t know i didn ’ t know they were doing that maybe they did it just for them i don ’ t know but — but they ’ re always going to have to have a test the president — it seems that a lot of people — because now we have test that really work well abbott in this case abbott we have other test being developed right now that are also fantastic the original test — the one we inherited jim a an example they were — they were broken they were obsolete they were not good test and that ’ s what we got stuck with we ’ ve developed some incredible test but this took to minute and they were all fine on the dpa sir — the president go ahead finish — finish your question thank you yeah so the problem some people have raised is that if the u stopped exporting what you could have is other country then deciding reciprocally that they are going to stop exporting — the president sure — and that the result of that then will be a net decrease in the amount of supply that american doctor american hospital have how do you address that the president well i address it in the following manner we really are very well supplied we are not the principal — it ’ s the hospital the state the city they ’ re supposed to get everything they can and stock up in case something like this happens but nobody could ever have assumed that something like this happened so we started supplying we brought tremendous amount to new york today and over the last few day we brought them to louisiana we brought them to michigan we brought them to los angeles a lot of equipment you ’ ve read the amount of mask that we had i think i said over million mask the mask the you know more expensive more complicated better whatever mask — the one they want to use in the hospital we have million of them now and we ’ ve given them to a lot we sent to bellevue in new york today — that wa for mayor de blasio — of them but we have million we ’ re going to have more than that and we ’ re getting them from various source including the military we ’ re rapidly then replacing them because we have to replace them in case there ’ s a — another emergency i would be — gown too we have many gown being delivered and have been delivered our people have done an incredible job most people have said — now and i said this yesterday — governor have said “ thank you very much great job if they ’ re a democrat governor — in some case not in all case at all — if i said “ here ’ s ventilator how many do you want “ we want “ here ’ s you got ’ em but you know what we ’ re going to do we ’ re going to add another is that good they said “ wow that ’ s great and then if jim acosta go and say “ are you happy with the president “ no he should have given u that ’ s what ’ s happening you know why because that ’ s a standard political answer and that ’ s a shame because we have done a job like nobody ha ever done a job but we ’ ve just delivered a lot of mask we ’ ve just delivered a lot of gown and protective gear but you know you ’ re talking about a massive — you ’ re talking about a massive number but a of this morning people were very very happy steve did oil executive ask you for a bailout of any sort the president no they didn ’ t ask for a bailout no what did they ask for the president it wa really more of a discussion than asking we discu — you know we did discus the concept of tariff because a you know this wa a dispute among a couple of country that i think they want to be able to get it solved they had a dispute they had a competition but they want to get it resolved russia — you mean tariff — tariff on — the president — and saudi arabia i think want to get it — — saudi and russia the president yeah i think they want to get it resolved i think they ’ re working very hard i mean they told me they want to get it resolved they ’ re working very hard go ahead president trump thank you yesterday jared kushner said the notion of the federal stockpile wa it ’ s supposed to be “ our ” stockpile it ’ s not supposed to be state stockpile that they then use what did he mean by “ our ” and — the president well why don ’ t you ask him and even the fact that taxpayer from every state pay for it — the president what ’ s that a “ gotcha ” “ i gotcha you used the word “ our ” no it ’ s not a “ gotcha what did he mean by it the president “ our ” — you know what “ our ” mean united state of america that ’ s what it mean it mean — so it mean the state the president our our it mean the united state of america and then we take that “ our ” and we distribute it to the state so why did he say it ’ s not supposed — the president not that we have to — — to be state stockpile that they then can use the president because we need it for the government and we need it for the federal government to give to the state the president but when the state are in trouble — no to also keep — then who are you giving to if it ’ s not to the state the president to keep — to keep for our country because the federal government need it too not just the state but out of that we oftentimes choose — a an example we have almost ventilator and we are ready to rock with those ventilator we ’ re going to bring them to various area of the country that need them but when he say “ our ” he ’ s talking about our country he ’ s talking — but he make the distinction the president excuse me and sir — the president he ’ s talking about the federal government i mean it ’ s such a basic simple question and you try and make it sound so bad it ’ s not bad i ’ m just trying to — the president you ought to be — you ought to be ashamed of yourself — understand no — by the way secretary azar — the president you know what you ought to be ashamed it ’ s such a simple question he said “ our and “ our ” mean for the country and “ our ” mean for the state — but then he said it ’ s not supposed to be state stockpile the president — because the state are part of the country don ’ t make it sound bad don ’ t make it sound bad go ahead steve go ahead back here but mr president the hhs even changed the language on the website the president you just asked your question you just asked your question in a very nasty tone i don ’ t think it wa nasty the president let ’ s go i think you didn ’ t give me an answer the president please mr president — the president i gave you a perfect answer you know it go ahead well just to follow up on that when we have the federal stockpile — i mean isn ’ t that designed to be able to distribute to the state who need it the president sure but it ’ s also needed for the federal government we have a federal stockpile and they have state stockpile and frankly they were — many of the state were totally unprepared for this so we had to go into the federal stockpile but we ’ re not an ordering clerk they have to have for themselves now some of the state were in good shape some of the state were not in good shape that ’ s probably something you could expect we have been helping state we have been spending a tremendous amount of time effort and billion and billion of dollar on making sure that they have what they have i mean take new york we built them hospital — i built them four hospital — built them medical center sent a ship with room and operating room and then on top of that gave vast number of ventilator and vast number of surgical gown equipment mask everything else now they had a chance to order ventilator over the year they had a chance to order a very big — but they didn ’ t choose to do it we were there and we helped them and i think the governor of new york is very thankful for the help that we gave but we have a stockpile it ’ s a federal stockpile we can use that for state or we can use it for ourselves we do use it for the federal government we have a very big federal government go ahead so have you decided not to use your power to be essentially a traffic cop for all the essential medical supply that are needed in this the president well we ’ re not a traffic cop we ’ re a humanitarian cop we help — it ’ s like the ship do you think we wanted to take two big ship into our country that have obvious problem and you know the problem i ’ m talking about so i have a decision to make do i take them in or do i save life okay do i take them in or do i save i decided to take them in and we have tremendous protection we have great doctor there to help the people they had four or five people that died that wa a of last night they died on the ship we took care of it and now the people are in the process of — and many are already back in canada they ’ re back in the uk — united kingdom and many of them were american citizen some were very sick we ’ re taking care of the sick people we ’ re testing all of the others very very carefully — very very carefully they are being tested like you wouldn ’ t believe and we solve a humanitarian catastrophe you know why because nobody else would take the ship nobody else would take them so we docked him in i think fort lauderdale i think some people are wondering why you don ’ t say “ we ’ re the federal government and there ’ s a shortage of mask and other thing and — the president we do say that — we ’ re going to — the president we do say that — sign off on every single shipment– the president we say we ’ re — we say and use the act — that need to go to place where it need to go ” the president excuse me we do say that and we use the act and we ’ ve used it a number of time very powerfully and a lot of time we don ’ t have to use it because we say “ we ’ re going to use it if you don ’ t do this or that ” and then we also have company that act incredibly well we have plenty of them — mostly them but we ’ ve used the act very powerfully and a lot of time you don ’ t have to exercise the act all you have to do is tell them “ look if you don ’ t do this we ’ re going to use the act ” and we ’ ve done a good job with it — maybe a great job yeah mr president there are news report that you want to sign the stimulus check that are going out here in several month is that right do you want to sign those check the president no me sign no there ’ s million of check i ’ m going to sign them no it ’ s a trump administration initiative but do i want to sign them no the people are getting — the people are getting their money there ’ s a lot of stimulus going in a lot of different way there ’ s also stimulus going for company that would — if it weren ’ t our government would not — and some company that were very strong a month ago again we had the strongest economy in the world we had our best ever we had probably the best economy in the history of the world bigger than china bigger than anybody and one day we have to say “ close it up stop everybody go home and you know what that ’ s pretty tough to do that that ’ s another thing — that there are rumor that these check may not go out for another four month like if you don ’ t have a direct deposit the president i don ’ t know all i can tell you is the small business today is — we ’ re way ahead of schedule there is a problem where — and — which i pointed out i said “ you shouldn ’ t do it this way ” — with unemployment where equipment by the state we ’ re sending the money to the state once the money is sent to the state then the state whether they ’ re republican or democrat have to get the money out to the people hopefully they ’ ll be able to do it but many of those state have computer i don ’ t know that they ’ re equipped i wanted to give them money direct if that ’ s what you ’ re talking about i wanted to give the money out direct it would have been much easier but the democrat and some people said “ no let ’ s do it the complicated way ” i ’ m talking more about the stimulus check the — like — the president all right well i wa talking about — — when will people get their money the president excuse me i wa talking about both yeah when will people get that money the president yeah they ’ ll get it they will go ahead please thank you sir i ’ d like to ask question both for myself and some of the other reporter who aren ’ t in the room social distancing the president sure first of all — and this is for yourself and dr birx what percentage of the population do we suspect to be asymptomatic at this point is there a way to figure that out it seems like the antibody test might be able to assist in determining that number the president go ahead deborah dr birx yeah thank you so while we ’ re working diligently in the midst of the crisis to make sure that the healthcare worker and everyone who is sick get provided for at the same time we ’ re working on test and assay that will be critical for surveillance and at the same time working on plan for what we need to do a this move through the population and we get on the downside where we ’ re sort of — we ’ re not there yet and hopefully most of the state will — say like california and washington and then what we need to do to be prepared for fall so all three of those thing are happening simultaneously and there ’ s people working on each one of those work stream the antibody piece is critical a you described because at this time we can ’ t — if we have — let ’ s say asymptomatic status is inversely — symptomatic status is inversely related to age and so the younger you are the more likely you are to be asymptomatic we have to know that because we have to know how many people have actually become infected so when we talked about five day ago — i think on monday — i called on university to work on an elisabased test to test for their health worker and really get through that at the same time the private sector is working on test and what do we want those test to be we want those test to be like what we use for hiv and malaria — finger prick onto a cassette you get a line if you ’ re positive and you get a control line negative the line isn ’ t there and there ’ s the control line that ’ s what — that ’ s our dream assay because it ’ s a finger prick in the meantime we ’ re not waiting i mean we ’ re pushing for that at the same time we ’ re asking to develop an assay — the elisabased assay which requires a tube of blood and that ’ s why we ’ re also talking about could we use dried blood spot we also put out a call directly out to the military because of the roosevelt to really test all of the sailor on the roosevelt with an antibody test to get to this critical issue of asymptomatic and already preexisting antibody that would be — if the first responder knew they already had had it and they had protective antibody if the nurse knew the doctor knew if your schoolteacher knew then it ’ s a very different dialogue so we understand the importance of that and we understand how important it is in relationship to understanding this epidemic one other comment because i know we ’ re always saying “ who knew what when i just want to make clear there ’ s country working on this collectively together it ’ s devastating for every single country when we get through this we can go back and look at what happened where and what doe this epidemic look like and when you get through it then you can validate every model there is known to man when you ’ re in the middle of it you have to concentrate on serving the need of each american and what that need look like at the same time you have these other work stream on surveillance and how to be prepared both scientifically and therapeutically and vaccinewise for the next fall if it happens again so i think these thing are happening together but i just want u to really concentrate on the fact that all around the globe country after country is dealing with this and we can talk about “ why didn ’ t italy do something or spain do something or germany do something or we can really say “ right now we all can we can do something we can do the social distancing and all of the piece that we know is starting to work around the globe in country after country and then when we get through all of this we can ask the question about “ could we have done some piece of this better a a global community ” i will remind you that on february the head of the who said there wa no reason to ever do a travel ban you know it wasn ’ t until january that we knew that there wa humantohuman transmission remember — dr birx the president wa saying this wa going to go away it ’ s april the president it is going to go away it is going away the president — but mr president you said it wa going to go away in april the president it ’ s going — i didn ’ t say a date you said “ when it warmed up in april… ” the president i said it ’ s going away and it is going away okay are you — dr birx — dr birx yes thank you sir but — if i ’ m — the president okay that wa a good answer to your question no no no no no no more that wa a long but a very good answer that wa enough for you i have a question on the insurance inaudible coverage mr president on the insurance coverage for treatment the way your government is going is trying to make sure that people are covered on the treatment for covid — the president yeah we ’ re going to do that doe that include the million people who are in this country illegally are they going to be covered a well the president we ’ ll be talking about that at a different time yeah please go head yes mr president will you release — authorize the release of the underlying data for the conclusion of the to people succumbing perhaps dr birx can talk — the president well that ’ s up to dr birx you ’ ll decide a to when — dr birx we can release all of the — i — some disease expert have expressed concern that they haven ’ t seen the underlying data they ’ re not questioning — the president i ’ m sure they ’ ll talk to you about that and dr fauci too please go ahead thank you mr president this is for you and secretary azar ten million people say they ’ ve lost their job in the past two week so how is this stimulus money for free treatment going to absorb the new number of uninsured and — the president go ahead if you want — go ahead — would it not be easier to reopen the obamacare market or expand medicaid secretary azar so for an individual who had employer insurance — that ’ s what i mentioned in my remark — if you were employed and had insurance through your employer and you ’ ve now lost your job and lost that insurance you now do have a special enrollment period where you may enroll in the individual exchange of the affordable care act so that ’ s — that ’ s existing law then what we ’ re doing is taking from that hundred billion dollar to provider taking money and saying “ if you ’ re a provider and you care for anybody who is uninsured we ’ re going to compensate you for doing that and we ’ re going to compensate you at the medicare reimbursement rate and you are not allowed to bill that uninsured individual anything ” so in many respect it ’ s better for those uninsured individual they ’ re going to get firstdollar coverage they ’ re going to get care in the united state and the provider is going to be made whole from this program so it ’ s really an unprecedented — what president trump is doing here with this money is an unprecedented diseasespecific support of care for individual to make sure that people get treatment will someone still be billed if they test negative or what about noncovid condition so i just have a couple of question about supply — one specifically on new york and the question of ventilator governor cuomo is saying that new york may be day away from running out of ventilator can you assure new york that going into next week that they ’ re going to have the ventilator that they ’ re going to need the president no they should ’ ve had more ventilator at the time they should have had more ventilator they were totally under serviced we are trying to do — we ’ re doing our best for new york you know we have — we have state we have a lot of state we have territory too but we have a lot of state that have to be taken care of some much more so than others we ’ ve worked very well with the governor we happen to think that he ’ s well served with ventilator we ’ re going to find out but we have other state to take care of we have a big problem in louisiana we have a big problem in michigan we have a big problem in seven other really strong hotspot but we ’ re doing the best we can i wish they did the original order three year ago they would ’ ve had all the ventilator they needed although even then they wouldn ’ t because if you look at what the original request wa from new york it wa far greater than anybody ever heard and we ’ ve — we ’ ve supplied a lot i told you we supplied some just today to new york and we supplied some yesterday to new york city did you have one in the back yeah please mr president if i can say — this is why the question about the stockpile that wa asked earlier is so important the president i don ’ t think that wa the question inaudible no it wa a very important question because what jared kushner said yesterday is that the federal stockpile is for use by the federal government not for the state to have access to so you seem to be saying different so did jared kushner misspeak yesterday the president no no he didn ’ t — he didn ’ t misspeak is that federal stockpile available to the state the president he used the word “ our okay “ our ” — “ our ” is referring to our country yeah but he said — he said it ’ s not for the state to use the president the state to the best of my knowledge and to the best of your knowledge are a part of our country we are taking what is in the federal stockpile and we are helping state all over the country but we also want to keep some because when that surge come when you hit those peak we ’ re going to need it and we have to be able to have the flexibility to take those ventilator and bring them to louisiana new york detroit different place that ’ s all but you will be using them for the state that need them the president oh of course we ’ re not using them anywhere else we ’ re not going to be using them jon anywhere else but we want the flexibility because you know we don ’ t even know when the surge is coming but it ’ s coming soon and it ’ s going to be big and some area won ’ t have it some area will be pleasantly surprised just like we ’ ve been you look at the chart state that i thought would have been maybe a disaster turned out to be — really they ’ ve done a great job some state are really troubled but you don ’ t know you don ’ t know we have great flexibility i would have preferred giving them all out we ’ d have nothing and now when we have a surge we can ’ t get them back from where we gave them because it ’ s very tough to take it back so we have tremendous flexibility and it could be new york it could be louisiana those are two that are really rough new jersey is very rough and they ’ ve done a very good job in new jersey but new jersey is very rough go ahead please in the back yes the question or — the question is about the cdc guideline i know that they changed over time from february and there is — the president the guideline relative to which — the mask for instance social distancing and the number of people who can gather in a group and so on and now we have this — this measure about wearing mask and i know you told steve about why you don ’ t want to wear a mask but i ’ m just wondering if you can tell u more about why because it would set — the president i ’ m just don ’ t choose to — an example the president they ’ re not mandatory guideline they ’ re guideline they suggest you could wear them you don ’ t have to wear them in fact the director is here if you want to say a couple of word about it you don ’ t — you can if you want you don ’ t have to but what i ’ m really inaudible your decision not to wear one the president but basically it ’ s — it ’ s a voluntary thing say it director he ’ s doing a good job dr redfield thank you very much i think i just want to reemphasize — i ’ ve said this before — that we ’ re not defenseless against this virus we have a powerful tool a powerful weapon that is social distancing and we ’ ve continued to embrace that with the president ’ s initiative to slow the spread of coronavirus we ’ re constantly looking at new data and a the surgeon general said one of the new information that became more clear to all of u is there ’ s a greater number of people that are asymptomatically infected than we previously thought a ambassador birx said that may be inversely related to age and so really the purpose here is first and foremost to embrace the social distancing that ’ s the number one thing that ’ s the powerful weapon and you know this virus ha a great weakness it can ’ t jump from one person to another if it ’ s got to swim more than six foot and this is why we really want that that said we now know that there may be individual in signif — area of significant community transmission that may be asymptomatically infected and we know that a face barrier can actually interrupt the number of virus particle that can go from one person to the other so a wa said by the vice president this is — and the president — the purpose of this face covering is to be another adjunctive mitigation strategy to protect someone from spreading the virus from themselves to someone else the president and i wa just tested also so i assume i don ’ t know have the virus so i don ’ t have to worry about spreading it okay please go ahead mr president i want to make sure we ’ re clear when you mentioned tariff earlier — the president yeah — that came up in a meeting are you considering tariff on saudi arabian oil and then also — the president well i can always consider — look tariff have made a tremendous amount of money for our country i put them on china i put them on other place and other country tariff u and they take advantage of u and they have for many year look country have taken advantage of the united state for year they ’ ve ripped u off like nobody can even believe whether it be on — on manufacturing whether it be on exporting whether it be on almost anything including military where we provide virtually free military assistance to country that frankly take advantage of u don ’ t even like u okay so this ha been going on for year they tariff u they create artificial — you could say nonfinancial barrier which are worse than financial barrier you can ’ t sell your product you can ’ t take care of our farmer they won ’ t take our — and yet they ’ ll take u and sell into u and we won ’ t charge them anything for doing it look they ’ ve taken advantage of u for year tariff are a way of evening the score tariff are a way of just neutralizing they have tariff on u and we now can put tariff on them am i using it for oil it ’ s something we can no — am i doing it now no am i thinking about imposing it a of this moment no but if we ’ re not treated fairly it ’ s certainly a tool in the toolbox and what about with russia are you — would you consider maybe lifting sanction or giving some sanction relief if they — the president well it would be the same thing no it would be the same thing they are having a dispute — the two country — and it ’ s hurting the rest of the world because it ’ s really hurting the energy industry russia is being hurt unbelievably badly and saudi arabia is being hurt unbelievably badly because oil and gas is a primary — that ’ s where they get most of their income and this is a price like from the all right it ’ s a price from the they are being hurt very badly i think they ’ re going to settle their dispute pretty quickly why — on the oil why do you think you haven ’ t been more successful on getting them to raise the price the president go ahead please why — why do you think you haven ’ t been more successful in getting them to increase production in russia and saudi arabia if inaudible the president well they have increased production that ’ s what they ’ ve done they ’ ve increased it so much that there ’ s so — you meant the opposite the president i meant — yeah why do you think you haven ’ t been successful in inaudible increase production the president yeah look look just so — well they ’ re going to stop because the market ultimately the market is going to get them to stop but they both did the opposite they increased production to a level that water is right now more valuable than oil who would have ever thought right you have relationship with — the president you go to — you go to some of these kingdom water is far more valuable than oil there ’ s so much oil it ’ s a tribute in a way inaudible the president but what happened is there wa a lot to start off with and then you had the virus and it knocked the hell out of the market it — in term of demand so there ’ s no demand and there ’ s tremendous supply so i mean you saw number where it wa down to and down frankly below it wa even below it ’ s an incredible thing the market but ultimately the marketplace will take care of it but i think they ’ re going to work out their problem fairly quickly okay go ahead mr president — thank you mr president we ’ re already talking about phase four of a stimulus right but you and pelosi and mcconnell are already talking about different thing that should be in it now last time people were telling me that the fact that you wouldn ’ t talk to pelosi wa an impediment and it really slowed thing down are you — the president i ’ d talk — if it were important to talk to her i ’ d talk to her are you going to talk to her during the — the president if it were important for the american people i ’ d talk to her but other than that i can have other people talking to her look you ready infrastructure is a great thing for me i think infrastructure for this country — we have an old broken infrastructure fifty year ago we were the envy of the world and then we spent all this money so stupidly in the middle east we spent — it ’ s going to be very close to trillion in the middle east how stupid wa that decision but they spent it on that and other thing we ’ ve got to fix our infrastructure but pelosi is already downplaying — the president that mean road highway tunnel airport everything we got to fix our infra — but pelosi is already kind of downplaying — the president and the beauty is because of the fact that we are so strong a a country we ’ re borrowing at zero we never had a chance to borrow at zero even in this country we ’ d never had a chance to borrow at zero we ’ re going borrow — this is a great time so we can fix our infrastructure and we ’ ll have almost no interest cost this is the time to do it steve one more question the death total projection that you shared with u earlier this week are we still on the current trajectory for that or have social distancing — the president which trajec — which one i have many trajectory for many thing the — to to are we still on that trajectory or have we made any improvement or maybe not enough time ha passed the president say — say it say it steve what have we made enough improvement the president on what on what on social distancing have the model changed have the model changed the president i ’ d have to ask dr fauci and i ’ d have — have to ask deborah have the model changed dr birx so a lot of the projection you can see are based on — there ’ s many different way to look at this and a we discussed on sunday some of it is based on the current global experience we are about i think or time the size of italy a different factor in spain and we look at all of those — what their projection are where they are currently and where that is going and so a lot of the work is based on how this virus ha moved through other population that ’ s a very direct way to see how the virus is impacting a population there ’ s also terrific model and so every day and every night one of the model that actually look at the model related to mortality is the healthdataorg data and they update it every night and you can see where we are in that projection i think in the last run of that model they were at or something in the model now all of that can be changed by our behavior and so — and all of it can be changed in a different way if we don ’ t follow those behavior if another major metropolitan area end up having an epidemic like the new york metro area that could dramatically change not the model but the reality of the impact of this virus on american and where are the model on — the president and by the way the model show hundred of thousand of people are going to die you know what i want to do i want to come away under the model the professional did the model i wa never involved in a model but — at least this kind of a model but you know what hundred of thousand of people they say are going to die i want much le than that i want none but it ’ s too late for that but i want very few people relative to what the model are saying those are projection i hope they ’ re wrong i hope we ’ re going to be under those projection mr president two question on continuity of government for — the president how come you always have two why can ’ t you have one well they ’ re related the president every time “ i have three question i have two question can you give me one instead because we have a couple of other people go ahead okay i ’ ll go with my second one the governor of wisconsin is now talking about delaying the primary at least not having inperson voting so my question is — and i asked this a couple week ago i want to see if you ’ ve made any progress on this looking ahead to the fall are you taking step to ensure that the general election will happen even if this pandemic ha reemerged or hasn ’ t gone away and — the president the general election will happen on november and do you — are you — the president in wisconsin what happened is i through social medium — medium put out a very strong endorsement of a republican conservative judge who ’ s an excellent brilliant judge he ’ s a justice and i hear what happened is his poll number went through the roof and because of that i think they delayed the election you don ’ t think the governor is concerned about people going to inperson voting the president i don ’ t know why didn ’ t he do it before he wa doing right before the election but do you think every — the president excuse me why didn ’ t he do this two week ago all of a sudden — but isn ’ t it — because of the pandemic the president excuse me all of a sudden an election which is taking place very soon get delayed now i just endorsed him today and it wa a very strong endorsement his poll — he ’ s gone very high up and all of a sudden the governor come out — the democrat governor by the way — come out and say “ oh we ’ re going to move this election so i don ’ t know i ’ m sure — i hope you ’ re right i hope you ’ re right but — but do you think every state in this country should be prepared for mailin voting in case we ’ re in a situation — the president no because i think a lot of people cheat with mailin voting i think people should vote with id — voter id i think voter id is very important and the reason they don ’ t want voter id is because they intend to cheat when you get something when you buy something you look at your card and credit card and different card — you have your picture on many of them not all of them but on many of them you should have a picture on your — on your — for voting it should be called “ voter id they should have that and it shouldn ’ t be mailin — but how are you going to — the president excuse me it shouldn ’ t be mailin voting it should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself you don ’ t send it in the mail where people pick up — all sort of bad thing can happen by the time they signed that if they sign that — if they signed that by the time it get in and is tabulated no it shouldn ’ t be mailed in you should vote at the booth and you should have voter id because when you have voter id that ’ s the real deal thank you very much we ’ ll see you tomorrow en pm edt</td>\n",

thank you the president thank you you go ahead i ’ ll talk to you later okay thank you very much everybody and i want to start by say that our hearts go out to the people of new york as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in america that seem to be the hotspot right now but you have some others as you know that be very — very bad very bad louisiana be get hit very hard part of michigan be get hit very very hard new jersey be — be –surprisingly it ’ s much greater than anybody would have think they ’ re do a really good job the governor be do a really good job out there new york ’ s first responders emts doctor nurse be show incredible courage under pressure they ’ re the best in the world we will take every action and we ’ ll spare no resource — financial medical scientific we will not spare anything we ’ ll get it back into shape the empire state — the governor be do an excellent job they ’ re all work very hard together at the request of the governor as you know the javits center we have bed and we ’ re go to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be look after the patients can be look after that be go to be for regular medical problems such as accidents and you know it ’ s very interest the governor be tell me we don ’ t have too many accidents and very few people drive so we ’ re go to put that facility into play which be a big facility the ship will be stay the way it be but we ’ re put that facility into play to help them and today also the cdc be announce additional step americans can take to defend against the transmission of the virus from recent study we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms be play a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understand so you don ’ t seem to have symptoms and it still get transfer in light of these study the cdc be advise the use of nonmedical cloth face cover as an additional voluntary public health measure so it ’ s voluntary you don ’ t have to do it they suggest for a period of time but this be voluntary i don ’ t think i ’ m go to be do it but you have a lot of ways — you can look at it as follow the cdc be recommend that americans wear a basic cloth or a fabric mask that can be either purchase online or simply make at home probably material that you ’ d have at home these face cover can be easily wash or reuse i want to emphasize that the cdc be not recommend the use of medicalgrade or surgicalgrade mask and we want that to be use for our great medical people that be work so hard and do some job medical protective gear must be reserve for the frontline healthcare workers who be perform those vital service the new mask guidelines also do not replace cdc ’ s guidance on social distance include stay in your home when possible stand at least six feet apart for a period of time again we ’ re go to all come back together here we ’ re go to all come back together and practice hand hygiene which we should do anyway a lot of things i think be go to spill over shake hand maybe will stay with our country for a long time beyond this one of the — one of our great doctor be tell me that — as you know we have flus every year and the number of people kill by the flu be very substantial and say that if they didn ’ t shake hand that number would be substantially lower so maybe it ’ ll stay maybe some of these things long term will be good but those guidelines be still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection so with the mask it ’ s go to be really a voluntary thing you can do it you don ’ t have to do it i ’ m choose not to do it but some people may want to do it and that ’ s okay it may be good probably will they ’ re make a recommendation it ’ s only a recommendation it ’ s voluntary we ’ re also take action to ensure the cost of no barrier to any american seek test or treatment of the coronavirus the largest insurer nationwide the bluecross blueshield system have now announce that it will not require any copays — which be really something that ’ s a tremendous statement — from patients of the virus treatment for the next days similar to the commitments of cigna humana anthem those be great company and they ’ re all do the same thing so copays for them to do that be — it ’ s a big statement we appreciate it today i can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treat uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimburse by the federal government use fund from the economic relief package congress pass last month so that be as per the question yesterday and actually the day before yesterday this should alleviate any concern uninsured americans may have about seek the coronavirus treatment so that ’ s i think answer the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people i ’ m also sign a directive invoke the defense production act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supply by unscrupulous actors and profiteer the security and secretary — the secretary of homeland security will work with fema to prevent the export of respirators surgical mask gloves and other personal protective equipment we need these items immediately for domestic use we have to have them but we ’ ve do really well with the purchase of items and you ’ ll be hear about that shortly we ’ ve already leverage the dpa to stop the hoard and price gouge of crucial supply under that authority this week the department of health and human service work with the department of justice take custody of nearly respirators surgical mask gloves as well as bottle — many many many bottle — and disinfectant spray that be be hoard all of this material be now be give to healthcare workers most of it have already be give out and we ’ ve give a lot to new york a lot in new jersey a lot to other place in addition to ensure that healthcare workers in new york have the protective equipment they need the federal government in the name of the department of defense be provide about million respirators department of defense and we ’ ve already give of them to new york city mayor de blasio need them very badly so we get them to mayor de blasio in new york city and they be very grateful million and we ’ re go to be increase that number from million to more that ’ s a lot of respirators today my team speak with the ceo of ochsner health and the ceo of lcmc the two largest health systems in new orleans they say they feel that they currently have enough ventilators — i think a lot of people be go to have enough ventilators — and mask and appreciate what we do and all of the things we ’ ve be do with them work with them the ceo of ochsner warner thomas — who ’ s really be fantastic i have to say — indicate a need for surgical gown and i instruct fema to deliver them tomorrow so they ’ ll have the that ’ s louisiana — new orleans two hundred and thirty thousand surgical gown they ’ ll have them by tomorrow we ’ re expand the role of the arm force in our response effort because no one be better prepare to win a war than the unite state military and we be in a war the invisible enemy — remember over retire army medical personnel have answer their nation ’ s call and be now support field hospitals and medical facilities all across the country like what i just tell you that governor cuomo request we do something in javits where we take it over and we ’ re go to have that man by the military because it ’ s very tough to get people — more people in the new york area so we ’ re go to have it man by the military — javits center national guard members have be activate to help state build new treatment center and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supply that include national guard the national guard be assist very strongly because the state be in many case unable to have the delivery capability from warehouse and other place that we put the supply so i ’ ve give approval to use the national guard — the various national guard in the different state and they ’ re do a fantastic job of not only protect people but deliver material the army corps of engineer have assess more than facilities in all state and be rapidly build temporary hospitals and alternative care sit in many state in new york new jersey michigan pennsylvania arizona california colorado florida illinois new mexico oregon washington wisconsin ohio they ’ re do a lot of work in just those state plus additionals that be be — will be announce probably tomorrow but they ’ re do some job the army corps of engineer — what a job they ’ re do and fema — what a job they ’ re do as we deploy the power of our military we ’ re also deploy the skill of our doctor scientists and medical researchers we continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies and the treatment and prevention of the virus and we will keep the american people fully inform on our find hydroxychloroquine — i don ’ t know it ’ s look like it ’ s have some good result i hope that — that would be a phenomenal thing but we have it right now in — approximately now it ’ s increase to people i speak with dr zucker in new york — terrific guy by the way he ’ s — we ’ re do a good job and i speak to governor cuomo last even and this morning about it so it ’ s be there for about three and a half days but i think — and many other place it ’ s be test too and we have a tremendous supply of it we ’ ve order it in the case that it work and it ’ s — it could have some pretty big impact and we ’ ll see what happen my administration be also work to get relief to american workers and businesses on day one of the paycheck protection program as kevin say more than billion in guarantee loan have be process to help small businesses keep their workers employ during the unprecedented time — this unprecedented time and bank of america have be incredible of the big bank bank of america have really step forward and do a great job and then you

partner be really incredible and they ’ re ensure that the money get to small businesses as quickly as possible and then the small business in turn take care of employees that they would have have to let go and now they ’ ll keep them and that ’ s good and then they ’ re go to open for business and they ’ re go to have their employees and we ’ ll try and get back to where we be eventually we ’ re go to supersede where we be the energy industry have be especially hard hit in the crisis this afternoon i meet with greg garland of phillips dave hager of devon energy harold hamm of continental resources jeff hildebrand of hilcorp energy vicki hollub of occidental petroleum mike sommers of the american petroleum institute kelcy warren of energy transfer partner mike wirth of chevron and

tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people and they ’ ve keep america really go for a long time and no big price hike no big anything i mean they ’ ve just keep it go and now they get hit but with all the job and all of the good that they do we ’ re go to make sure that they stay in good shape america be engage in a historic battle to safeguard the live of our citizens our future society

but low rate and we know as governor newsom say yesterday that they ’ re not out of the woods yet we continue to flow resources but we want to commend people in those state and all across the country

these innovative new test not just to meet this moment but to lay a foundation for test across the nation in the months ahead as the president mention he meet with energy executives today and continue to engage with leaders of businesses all across the nation we also have hold a teleconference today with commercial retailers on the president ’ s behalf we thank them for the way that people that operate malls and shop center around the country have embrace and enact the coronavirus guidelines for america it ’ s have enormous impact on their businesses and their industries but i hear — i hear

coronavirus treatment i ’ m please to report at the president ’ s direction medicaid and medicare already expand to coronavirus treatment and test early on and of course the president just indicate how major insurance company across the country be not just waive copays on test but they ’ re now waive copays for at least days on any coronavirus treatment but now as secretary azar will enumerate now we ’ ll make sure that any american even those that have no insurance will be able to receive treatment in a hospital and never have to worry about the bill i ’ ll just give a general reminder to every american there be evidence across the country that you ’ re put into practice the coronavirus guidelines for america every american have a role to play and i want to thank you on behalf of the president and all of the american people for the way that you ’ re step forward you ’ re engage in the social distance and do the things that will slow the spread we encourage you to keep on keep on

ask every american to really be discipline about these guidelines and really determine to stay in that space of execution you know we be just in week three on — of this full guidance measure we really do appreciate the work of the citizens of california and washington state because we do see that their curve be different their curve be different from new york new jersey and connecticut and we really believe that the work that every citizen be do in those state be make a difference and it will make a difference for the frontline healthcare providers we also be deeply grateful despite the way their curve look today they continue to get ready for a different potential so that they can ensure that patients if they do get sick have options and availability to all the frontline healthcare workers in the — what we have refer to as “ hot zone ” — areas where the number of case be quite significant — the new orleans the new york city metro area include new jersey and connecticut — the incredible work that the frontline healthcare workers be provide we ’ re really work now at a much more granular level talk directly to hospitals to ensure that they have the supply that they need in coordination with state and local governments and to work — i think we discuss it yesterday but i think it be quite clear also — and reiterate by governor cuomo today — that we have to support one another as each of these different metro areas and other areas move through their peak of new infections when we talk about it at the begin of this week we talk about this week and next week be incredibly difficult and we want to recognize the number of americans who have lose their live to this virus and recognize the sacrifice that healthcare providers be make both in their care but i think i ’ m very uplift by hear their message to families and their compassion for others to provide that kind of support to the individuals in the hospital we continue to watch in addition the chicago area the detroit area and have some develop concern around colorado the district of columbia and pennsylvania so as you can see each of these will follow their own curve we ’ ll be get more and more of those case over time information in a very granular way to each and every one of you so that we can follow these epidemiologic curve as each of these state counties and communities move through this together in solidarity and really ensure that we can move supply creatively around the country to meet the need of both the frontline healthcare providers but also every american who need our support right now thank you the president thank you very much secretary azar well thank you mr president for your continue leadership as we battle the coronavirus first i want to thank all of the members of the hhs team and the frontline healthcare workers across america include those who — those service workers who serve in our hospitals at our healthcare facilities those who clean those who

a brief update on the administration ’ s plan to cover the test and treatment for the uninsured get the uninsured access to the care they need be a top priority for president trump we be already roll out the billion in fund from the families first coronavirus response act to cover providers ’ expense for test and diagnose the uninsured the care act sign by the president include another billion for healthcare providers under the president ’ s direction we will use a portion of that fund to cover providers ’ cost of deliver care for the uninsured send the money to providers through the same mechanism use for test as a condition of receive fund under this program providers will be forbid from balance bill the uninsured for the cost of their care providers will be reimburse at medicare rat we will soon have more specifics on how the rest of the billion will go to providers we ’ re work to ensure that this fund be distribute in a way that be fast fair simple and transparent i ’ d also like to remind people that if you ’ ve lose employer insurance coverage you have insurance options that you should look into you ’ d be eligible for a special enrollment period on the healthcare exchange and depend on your state you may be eligible for medicaid just as president trump be work to ensure that treatment be pay for he ’ s work to support new treatment options for patients thank to the president ’ s leadership many providers be try different experimental therapies and we need as much data as we can collect as quickly as possible on how these treatments be work today oracle have develop and be donate to the government and the american people a web portal and platform to gather crowdsourced realtime information from providers about how patients respond to potential therapeutics while this doesn ’ t replace the important work of clinical trials it give us data rapidly if you be a doctor or a healthcare provider and you would like to help us you can sign up today to begin report on your work there ’ s a special registration page for providers at thank you very much the president thank you very much okay let ’ s go steve if we could draw you out a little bite more on the advice on face mask what do — what would people gain from wear a mask and why be you oppose to wear one yourself the president well i just don ’ t want to wear one myself it ’ s a recommendation they recommend it i ’ m feel good i just don ’ t want to be do — i don ’ t know somehow sit in the oval office behind that beautiful resolute desk — the great resolute desk — i think wear a face mask as i greet presidents prime minister dictators kings queen i don ’ t know somehow i don ’ t see it for myself i just — i just don ’ t maybe i ’ ll change my mind but this will pass and hopefully it ’ ll pass very quickly now with that be say if somebody want to — i mean most people can just make something out of a certain material so it ’ s very well designate it ’ s very simple to do i win ’ t be do it personally it ’ s a recommendation okay and would you like to say something about that surgeon general adams sure absolutely the president surgeon general please surgeon general adams well thank you mr president mr vice president mr secretary and cdc director redfield i especially want to thank the folks at the cdc and it ’ s a great question that you ask it ’ s a fair question that you ask i want to unpack the evolution of our guidance on mask because it have be confuse to the american people first of all i want people to understand that the cdc the world health organization my office and most public health and health organizations and professionals originally recommend against the general public wear mask because base on the best evidence available at the time it be not deem that that would have a significant impact on whether or not a healthy person wear a mask would contract we have always recommend that symptomatic people wear a mask because if you ’ re cough if you have a fever if you ’ re symptomatic you could transmit disease to other people what have change in our recommendation well it ’ s important to know that we now know from recent study that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms they ’ re what we call asymptomatic and that even those who eventually become presymptomatic mean that they will develop symptoms in the future can transmit the virus to others before they show symptoms this mean that the virus can spread between people interact in close proximity for example cough speak or sneeze even if those people be not exhibit symptoms in light of this new evidence cdc recommend and the task force recommend wear cloth face cover in public settings where other social distance measure be difficult to maintain these include place like grocery store and pharmacies we especially recommend this in areas of significant communitybased transmission it be critical and the president mention this the vice president mention this it ’ s critical to emphasize that maintain six feet of social distance remain key to slow the spread of the virus but cdc be additionally advise the use of simple cloth cover to slow the spread of the virus and to help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmit it to others the cloth face cover recommend be not surgical mask or respirators those be critical supply that must continue to be reserve for healthcare workers and other medical first responders as recommend by the current cdc guidance as the president also mention cloth face cover fashion from household items or make at home from common materials at low cost can be use as an additional voluntary public health measure this recommendation complement and do not replace the president ’ s coronavirus guidelines for america “ days to slow the spread ” which remain the cornerstone of our national effort to slow the spread of the virus cdc be always — always look at the data we tell you that from the begin — dr birx say it every single press conference — we ’ re look at the data we ’ re evolve our recommendations and new recommendations will come as the evidence dictate so i want to say if you do choose to wear a face mask — very important — wash your hand first because you don ’ t want to put on a face cover with a dirty hand do not touch your face while you be wear the face cover because again you could take materials from the surface germs from the surface and bring it to your face if you choose to wear a face cover please — please leave the mask the medical supply for the medical professionals healthcare workers and frontline workers know that this be not a substitute for social distance and remember this be all about me protect you and you protect me this be about us come together as communities and if people voluntarily choose to wear a face cover they ’ re wear it to protect their neighbor from get the coronavirus because again they could have asymptomatic spread so mr president thank you very much for that the president thank you thank you surgeon general adams appreciate the opportunity to update everyone the president great job thank you okay jon mr president dr fauci last night recommend — say that every state should have stayathome order right now do you agree with that should every state in this country have the kind of stayathome order that we now see in place like washington and new york the president i leave it up to the governors the governors know what they ’ re do they ’ ve be do a great job i guess we ’ re close to percent anyway and the state that we ’ re talk about be not in jeopardy no i would leave it to the governors i like — i like that from the standpoint of govern and i like that from the standpoint of even our constitution please mr president to address the shortage in the blood supply the food and drug administration announce yesterday — the president well i point to him right thank mr president the president i know we inaudible i hear a different voice i hear a different voice go ahead we ’ ll get you later go to the oil meet previously — the president yeah — be the us will to cut domestic oil production what come out of the meet what be the consensus the president well a lot of things come out it ’ s a great industry it ’ s an important industry it ’ s a tremendous jobproducing industry and it ’ s just vital and it be also very interest because they all be give the test before they come into the room so you have the head of exxon mobil you have all these guy take the test and they all pass with fly color so that be good they leave happy in that respect at least there ’ s just an overabundance of oil right now — oil and gas tremendous overabundance and it be cause — they be do a great job they be produce a lot of energy but then you have the virus come along and it knock another percent maybe percent off of the market so there ’ s too much oil there ’ s a glut and these be great company and they ’ ll figure it out it ’ s free market we ’ ll figure it out you speak to president putin i mean what ’ s on the table here with him — the president and with the crown prince both yeah the president they be have a competition we ’ ll see how it all work out i think it ’ s go to work out very well it ’ s go to take a long time to — to get rid of that there ’ s massive excess amount of oil and gas massive like probably there ’ s never be so where that do work out well i guess you could say be for drivers i think in certain locations it ’ s down to and cents a gallon right now on the road but we have a tremendous industry a great industry a tremendously important industry from the standpoint of job and we ’ re energy independent we have to make sure we keep it that way all right please go ahead mr president as i be say the food and drug administration to address the shortage of blood supply announce yesterday it would ease the restrictions on certain donors include gay men who be now require to be abstinent for months as oppose to months to donate do you have a hand in that change the president no i didn ’ t know anything about that that be do by the fda — very capable people at the fda please go ahead yes mr president both the government of canada and be push back on this dpa not to export respirators the president yeah say — the president i don ’ t blame them they can push back if they want yeah but they ’ re say — the president we ’ re not happy with we ’ re not happy and the people that deal with it directly be not at all happy with so we ’ ll see whether or not we do i hear what he have to say today i don ’ t know the gentleman but we ’ re not happy with go ahead and where be dr fauci the president i don ’ t know but every time you ask that question — whenever he ’ s not here you look you say “ where be he and you ’ ll say “ be there a problem no problem whatsoever every time he ’ s not here — sometimes i ’ ll ask him to come because that ’ s the first question that you and a couple of others from the fake news establishment ask be “ where be dr fauci we ’ re do great together a different subject if i may ask the president except we ’ re cover a different subject today go ahead a different subject if i may ask the president go ahead jim try another one mr president you have you have say nobody could have

problem around the world a pandemic of this nature who drop the ball the president well i always know that pandemics be one of the worst things that could happen there ’ s be nothing like this since probably that be the big one in europe it start actually here and go to europe probably i ’ ve hear about — you ’ ve also say nobody could see this come the president excuse me wait a minute let me finish i ’ ve hear about this for a long time — pandemics you don ’ t want pandemics and i don ’ t think he be talk about a specific pandemic he be talk about the threat of a pandemic could happen and it could happen most people think it wouldn ’ t and most people didn ’ t understand the severity of it this be a very severe what ’ s happen be very severe but i ’ d let you answer that i assume that he be talk about the concept of a pandemic secretary azar thank you mr president actually — absolutely for years now this country have have a massive effort at the federal state and local level of preparedness for a pandemic now that largely have be as i say in those remark about pandemic flu preparedness we know about sars we know about mers which be earlier modifications or variants of the coronavirus none of those achieve anything like what we ’ re see today but that ’ s why for successive presidencies include the leadership of president trump there have be a great focus on pandemic preparedness in fact it be just in november i believe that the president sign the pandemic flu preparedness executive order that we have — and we have also update the pandemic crisis action plan which have be the playbook from which we ’ ve be work the pandemic flu plan again the action plan from which we have be work that coordinate the wholeofgovernment wholeofeconomy approach here so we ’ ve all be very focus on pandemic preparedness that ’ s what we do but this particular strain of pandemic who would — who would have know this particular strain but secretary azar if you be prepare for a pandemic if this government be prepare for a pandemic why be it we don ’ t have enough mask why be it we don ’ t have enough medical equipment in this country the president previous administrations give us very little ammunition for the military and very little shelf space let me just tell you — but you ’ ve be president — the president you know it — you ’ ve be president — the president you know the answer — three or four years now the president the previous administration the shelve be empty the shelve be empty you have time to stock the shelve the president so what you should do be speak to the people from the previous administration jim and ask them that question because — mr president you ’ ve be in office — the president — the shelve be empty — for almost four years the president and you know what else the military shelve be also empty we have no ammunition literally and that be say by one of your favorite general “ we have — sir we have no ammunition guess what we have very little medical supply also all right go ahead please isn ’ t that a copout though the president go ahead isn ’ t that a copout the president we ’ ll get it back we ’ ll get you back but mr president — the president we ’ ll get you back please but what about that question — the president jim i say we ’ ll get you back please go ahead so i want to ask about the dpa so you say that there will be a ban on export of all — what do it cover so mask gloves what else be include in that order the president it cover everything and be you concern — the president but if somebody order — if italy if spain who have big problems — these have — these be countries with tremendous problems — france if they order — if they have longterm order and they ’ re in in there and they want to get certain things i ’ ve let them go out in certain instance because i think it ’ s only fair they have problems that be proportionately or relatively bigger than our problems so if they order something and they ’ re wait for as an example mask make here and go to italy i ’ m not go to be stop that i think it would be very unfair and by the way speak about be fair and unfair two very big cruise liners as you know i allow them to dock today we work with the governor of florida as you know ron desantis and we work on it and we have tremendous security and we take the sick people and we ’ re work with them we have doctor we have great doctor military doctor and from a humane standpoint not that we ’ re in love with this — these be two massive ship — but we have to take care of people we have to take care we send many back to canada the canada — the canadians come and work very closely with us as do the uk we have a lot of people from the uk and we take — we take care of the americans we take care of the sick we have some people very sick i think we have three to four maybe five people that have die on the boat one of the boat actually and we have to take care of these people so we couldn ’ t let them float aimlessly into the ocean look for port as they ’ ve be do for a long time and i make the decision we have to take them in and homeland security and a lot of other people do a great job but we have to help people these be people that be very very sick some be die some die please mr president on dpa — can i just finish please the president go ahead yeah go ahead mr president your staff they say that people in close proximity to you and the vice president will get a coronavirus test i ’ m wonder be you concern that the people you ’ ve be hang around with may have the virus the president no i ’ m not concern no i have a test yesterday but what ’ s the reason for the order for people who meet with you or talk to you why should they require coronavirus test the president i don ’ t know i mean i just — i hear from the oil executives these be people — most of them have not have the test and frankly i think they leave the room feel good about a lot of things but they felt good about the test this be a test that take i guess minutes to have it finalize they take the test i don ’ t know i didn ’ t know they be do that maybe they do it just for them i don ’ t know but — but they ’ re always go to have to have a test the president — it seem that a lot of people — because now we have test that really work well abbott in this case abbott we have other test be develop right now that be also fantastic the original test — the ones we inherit jim as an example they be — they be break they be obsolete they be not good test and that ’ s what we get stick with we ’ ve develop some incredible test but this take to minutes and they be all fine on the dpa sir — the president go ahead finish — finish your question thank you yeah so the problem some people have raise be that if the us stop export what you could have be other countries then decide reciprocally that they be go to stop export — the president sure — and that the result of that then will be a net decrease in the amount of supply that american doctor american hospitals have how do you address that the president well i address it in the follow manner we really be very well supply we be not the principal — it ’ s the hospitals the state the cities they ’ re suppose to get everything they can and stock up in case something like this happen but nobody could ever have assume that something like this happen so we start supply we bring tremendous amount to new york today and over the last few days we bring them to louisiana we bring them to michigan we bring them to los angeles a lot of equipment you ’ ve read the amount of mask that we have i think i say over million mask the mask the you know more expensive more complicate better whatever mask — the ones they want to use in the hospitals we have millions of them now and we ’ ve give them to a lot we send to bellevue in new york today — that be for mayor de blasio — of them but we have million we ’ re go to have more than that and we ’ re get them from various source include the military we ’ re rapidly then replace them because we have to replace them in case there ’ s a — another emergency i would be — gown too we have many gown be deliver and have be deliver our people have do an incredible job most people have say — now and i say this yesterday — governors have say “ thank you very much great job if they ’ re a democrat governor — in some case not in all case at all — if i say “ here ’ s ventilators how many do you want “ we want “ here ’ s you get ’ em but you know what we ’ re go to do we ’ re go to add another be that good they say “ wow that ’ s great and then if jim acosta go and say “ be you happy with the president “ no he should have give us that ’ s what ’ s happen you know why because that ’ s a standard political answer and that ’ s a shame because we have do a job like nobody have ever do a job but we ’ ve just deliver a lot of mask we ’ ve just deliver a lot of gown and protective gear but you know you ’ re talk about a massive — you ’ re talk about a massive number but as of this morning people be very very happy steve do oil executives ask you for a bailout of any sort the president no they didn ’ t ask for a bailout no what do they ask for the president it be really more of a discussion than ask we discu — you know we do discuss the concept of tariff because as you know this be a dispute among a couple of countries that i think they want to be able to get it solve they have a dispute they have a competition but they want to get it resolve russia — you mean tariff — tariff on — the president — and saudi arabia i think want to get it — — saudi and russia the president yeah i think they want to get it resolve i think they ’ re work very hard i mean they tell me they want to get it resolve they ’ re work very hard go ahead president trump thank you yesterday jar kushner say the notion of the federal stockpile be it ’ s suppose to be “ our ” stockpile it ’ s not suppose to be state stockpile that they then use what do he mean by “ our ” and — the president well why don ’ t you ask him and even the fact that taxpayers from every state pay for it — the president what ’ s that a “ gotcha ” “ i gotcha you use the word “ our ” no it ’ s not a “ gotcha what do he mean by it the president “ our ” — you know what “ our ” mean unite state of america that ’ s what it mean it mean — so it mean the state the president our our it mean the unite state of america and then we take that “ our ” and we distribute it to the state so why do he say it ’ s not suppose — the president not that we have to — — to be state stockpile that they then can use the president because we need it for the government and we need it for the federal government to give to the state the president but when the state be in trouble — no to also keep — then who be you give to if it ’ s not to the state the president to keep — to keep for our country because the federal government need it too not just the state but out of that we oftentimes choose — as an example we have almost ventilators and we be ready to rock with those ventilators we ’ re go to bring them to various areas of the country that need them but when he say “ our ” he ’ s talk about our country he ’ s talk — but he make the distinction the president excuse me and sir — the president he ’ s talk about the federal government i mean it ’ s such a basic simple question and you try and make it sound so bad it ’ s not bad i ’ m just try to — the president you ought to be — you ought to be ashamed of yourself — understand no — by the way secretary azar — the president you know what you ought to be ashamed it ’ s such a simple question he say “ our and “ our ” mean for the country and “ our ” mean for the state — but then he say it ’ s not suppose to be state stockpile the president — because the state be part of the country don ’ t make it sound bad don ’ t make it sound bad go ahead steve go ahead back here but mr president the hhs even change the language on the website the president you just ask your question you just ask your question in a very nasty tone i don ’ t think it be nasty the president let ’ s go i think you didn ’ t give me an answer the president please mr president — the president i give you a perfect answer you know it go ahead well just to follow up on that when we have the federal stockpile — i mean isn ’ t that design to be able to distribute to the state who need it the president sure but it ’ s also need for the federal government we have a federal stockpile and they have state stockpile and frankly they be — many of the state be totally unprepared for this so we have to go into the federal stockpile but we ’ re not an order clerk they have to have for themselves now some of the state be in good shape some of the state be not in good shape that ’ s probably something you could expect we have be help state we have be spend a tremendous amount of time effort and billions and billions of dollars on make sure that they have what they have i mean take new york we build them hospitals — i build them four hospitals — build them medical center send a ship with room and operate room and then on top of that give vast number of ventilators and vast number of surgical gown equipment mask everything else now they have a chance to order ventilators over the years they have a chance to order a very big — but they didn ’ t choose to do it we be there and we help them and i think the governor of new york be very thankful for the help that we give but we have a stockpile it ’ s a federal stockpile we can use that for state or we can use it for ourselves we do use it for the federal government we have a very big federal government go ahead so have you decide not to use your power to be essentially a traffic cop for all the essential medical supply that be need in this the president well we ’ re not a traffic cop we ’ re a humanitarian cop we help — it ’ s like the ship do you think we want to take two big ship into our country that have obvious problems and you know the problems i ’ m talk about so i have a decision to make do i take them in or do i save live okay do i take them in or do i save i decide to take them in and we have tremendous protection we have great doctor there to help the people they have four or five people that die that be as of last night they die on the ship we take care of it and now the people be in the process of — and many be already back in canada they ’ re back in the uk — unite kingdom and many of them be american citizens some be very sick we ’ re take care of the sick people we ’ re test all of the others very very carefully — very very carefully they be be test like you wouldn ’ t believe and we solve a humanitarian catastrophe you know why because nobody else would take the ship nobody else would take them so we dock him in i think fort lauderdale i think some people be wonder why you don ’ t say “ we ’ re the federal government and there ’ s a shortage of mask and other things and — the president we do say that — we ’ re go to — the president we do say that — sign off on every single shipment– the president we say we ’ re — we say and use the act — that need to go to place where it need to go ” the president excuse me we do say that and we use the act and we ’ ve use it a number of time very powerfully and a lot of time we don ’ t have to use it because we say “ we ’ re go to use it if you don ’ t do this or that ” and then we also have company that act incredibly well we have plenty of them — mostly them but we ’ ve use the act very powerfully and a lot of time you don ’ t have to exercise the act all you have to do be tell them “ look if you don ’ t do this we ’ re go to use the act ” and we ’ ve do a good job with it — maybe a great job yeah mr president there be news report that you want to sign the stimulus check that be go out here in several months be that right do you want to sign those check the president no me sign no there ’ s millions of check i ’ m go to sign them no it ’ s a trump administration initiative but do i want to sign them no the people be get — the people be get their money there ’ s a lot of stimulus go in a lot of different ways there ’ s also stimulus go for company that would — if it weren ’ t our government would not — and some company that be very strong a month ago again we have the strongest economy in the world we have our best ever we have probably the best economy in the history of the world bigger than china bigger than anybody and one day we have to say “ close it up stop everybody go home and you know what that ’ s pretty tough to do that that ’ s another thing — that there be rumor that these check may not go out for another four months like if you don ’ t have a direct deposit the president i don ’ t know all i can tell you be the small business today be — we ’ re way ahead of schedule there be a problem where — and — which i point out i say “ you shouldn ’ t do it this way ” — with unemployment where equipment by the state we ’ re send the money to the state once the money be send to the state then the state whether they ’ re republican or democrat have to get the money out to the people hopefully they ’ ll be able to do it but many of those state have computers i don ’ t know that they ’ re equip i want to give them money direct if that ’ s what you ’ re talk about i want to give the money out direct it would have be much easier but the democrats and some people say “ no let ’ s do it the complicate way ” i ’ m talk more about the stimulus check the — like — the president all right well i be talk about — — when will people get their money the president excuse me i be talk about both yeah when will people get that money the president yeah they ’ ll get it they will go ahead please thank you sir i ’ d like to ask question both for myself and some of the other reporters who aren ’ t in the room social distance the president sure first of all — and this be for yourself and dr birx what percentage of the population do we suspect to be asymptomatic at this point be there a way to figure that out it seem like the antibody test might be able to assist in determine that number the president go ahead deborah dr birx yeah thank you so while we ’ re work diligently in the midst of the crisis to make sure that the healthcare workers and everyone who be sick get provide for at the same time we ’ re work on test and assay that will be critical for surveillance and at the same time work on plan for what we need to do as this move through the population and we get on the downside where we ’ re sort of — we ’ re not there yet and hopefully most of the state will — say like california and washington and then what we need to do to be prepare for fall so all three of those things be happen simultaneously and there ’ s people work on each one of those work stream the antibody piece be critical as you describe because at this time we can ’ t — if we have — let ’ s say asymptomatic status be inversely — symptomatic status be inversely relate to age and so the younger you be the more likely you be to be asymptomatic we have to know that because we have to know how many people have actually become infect so when we talk about five days ago — i think on monday — i call on universities to work on an elisabased test to test for their health workers and really get through that at the same time the private sector be work on test and what do we want those test to be we want those test to be like what we use for hiv and malaria — finger prick onto a cassette you get a line if you ’ re positive and you get a control line negative the line isn ’ t there and there ’ s the control line that ’ s what — that ’ s our dream assay because it ’ s a finger prick in the meantime we ’ re not wait i mean we ’ re push for that at the same time we ’ re ask to develop an assay — the elisabased assay which require a tube of blood and that ’ s why we ’ re also talk about could we use dry blood spot we also put out a call directly out to the military because of the roosevelt to really test all of the sailors on the roosevelt with an antibody test to get to this critical issue of asymptomatic and already preexist antibody that would be — if the first responders know they already have have it and they have protective antibody if the nurse know the doctor know if your schoolteacher know then it ’ s a very different dialogue so we understand the importance of that and we understand how important it be in relationship to understand this epidemic one other comment because i know we ’ re always say “ who know what when i just want to make clear there ’ s countries work on this collectively together it ’ s devastate for every single country when we get through this we can go back and look at what happen where and what do this epidemic look like and when you get through it then you can validate every model there be know to man when you ’ re in the middle of it you have to concentrate on serve the need of each american and what that need look like at the same time you have these other work stream on surveillance and how to be prepare both scientifically and therapeutically and vaccinewise for the next fall if it happen again so i think these things be happen together but i just want us to really concentrate on the fact that all around the globe country after country be deal with this and we can talk about “ why didn ’ t italy do something or spain do something or germany do something or we can really say “ right now we all can we can do something we can do the social distance and all of the piece that we know be start to work around the globe in country after country and then when we get through all of this we can ask the question about “ could we have do some piece of this better as a global community ” i will remind you that on february the head of the who say there be no reason to ever do a travel ban you know it wasn ’ t until january that we know that there be humantohuman transmission remember — dr birx the president be say this be go to go away it ’ s april the president it be go to go away it be go away the president — but mr president you say it be go to go away in april the president it ’ s go — i didn ’ t say a date you say “ when it warm up in april… ” the president i say it ’ s go away and it be go away okay be you — dr birx — dr birx yes thank you sir but — if i ’ m — the president okay that be a good answer to your question no no no no no no more that be a long but a very good answer that be enough for you i have a question on the insurance inaudible coverage mr president on the insurance coverage for treatment the way your government be go be try to make sure that people be cover on the treatment for covid — the president yeah we ’ re go to do that do that include the million people who be in this country illegally be they go to be cover as well the president we ’ ll be talk about that at a different time yeah please go head yes mr president will you release — authorize the release of the underlie data for the conclusion of the to people succumb perhaps dr birx can talk — the president well that ’ s up to dr birx you ’ ll decide as to when — dr birx we can release all of the — i — some disease experts have express concern that they haven ’ t see the underlie data they ’ re not question — the president i ’ m sure they ’ ll talk to you about that and dr fauci too please go ahead thank you mr president this be for you and secretary azar ten million people say they ’ ve lose their job in the past two weeks so how be this stimulus money for free treatment go to absorb the new number of uninsured and — the president go ahead if you want — go ahead — would it not be easier to reopen the obamacare market or expand medicaid secretary azar so for an individual who have employer insurance — that ’ s what i mention in my remark — if you be employ and have insurance through your employer and you ’ ve now lose your job and lose that insurance you now do have a special enrollment period where you may enroll in the individual exchange of the affordable care act so that ’ s — that ’ s exist law then what we ’ re do be take from that hundred billion dollars to providers take money and say “ if you ’ re a provider and you care for anybody who be uninsured we ’ re go to compensate you for do that and we ’ re go to compensate you at the medicare reimbursement rat and you be not allow to bill that uninsured individual anything ” so in many respect it ’ s better for those uninsured individuals they ’ re go to get firstdollar coverage they ’ re go to get care in the unite state and the provider be go to be make whole from this program so it ’ s really an unprecedented — what president trump be do here with this money be an unprecedented diseasespecific support of care for individuals to make sure that people get treatment will someone still be bill if they test negative or what about noncovid condition so i just have a couple of question about supply — one specifically on new york and the question of ventilators governor cuomo be say that new york may be days away from run out of ventilators can you assure new york that go into next week that they ’ re go to have the ventilators that they ’ re go to need the president no they should ’ ve have more ventilators at the time they should have have more ventilators they be totally under service we be try to do — we ’ re do our best for new york you know we have — we have state we have a lot of state we have territories too but we have a lot of state that have to be take care of some much more so than others we ’ ve work very well with the governor we happen to think that he ’ s well serve with ventilators we ’ re go to find out but we have other state to take care of we have a big problem in louisiana we have a big problem in michigan we have a big problem in seven other really strong hotspots but we ’ re do the best we can i wish they do the original order three years ago they would ’ ve have all the ventilators they need although even then they wouldn ’ t because if you look at what the original request be from new york it be far greater than anybody ever hear and we ’ ve — we ’ ve supply a lot i tell you we supply some just today to new york and we supply some yesterday to new york city do you have one in the back yeah please mr president if i can say — this be why the question about the stockpile that be ask earlier be so important the president i don ’ t think that be the question inaudible no it be a very important question because what jar kushner say yesterday be that the federal stockpile be for use by the federal government not for the state to have access to so you seem to be say different so do jar kushner misspeak yesterday the president no no he didn ’ t — he didn ’ t misspeak be that federal stockpile available to the state the president he use the word “ our okay “ our ” — “ our ” be refer to our country yeah but he say — he say it ’ s not for the state to use the president the state to the best of my knowledge and to the best of your knowledge be a part of our country we be take what be in the federal stockpile and we be help state all over the country but we also want to keep some because when that surge come when you hit those peak we ’ re go to need it and we have to be able to have the flexibility to take those ventilators and bring them to louisiana new york detroit different place that ’ s all but you will be use them for the state that need them the president oh of course we ’ re not use them anywhere else we ’ re not go to be use them jon anywhere else but we want the flexibility because you know we don ’ t even know when the surge be come but it ’ s come soon and it ’ s go to be big and some areas win ’ t have it some areas will be pleasantly surprise just like we ’ ve be you look at the chart state that i think would have be maybe a disaster turn out to be — really they ’ ve do a great job some state be really trouble but you don ’ t know you don ’ t know we have great flexibility i would have prefer give them all out we ’ d have nothing and now when we have a surge we can ’ t get them back from where we give them because it ’ s very tough to take it back so we have tremendous flexibility and it could be new york it could be louisiana those be two that be really rough new jersey be very rough and they ’ ve do a very good job in new jersey but new jersey be very rough go ahead please in the back yes the question or — the question be about the cdc guidelines i know that they change over time from february and there be — the president the guidelines relative to which — the mask for instance social distance and the number of people who can gather in a group and so on and now we have this — this measure about wear mask and i know you tell steve about why you don ’ t want to wear a mask but i ’ m just wonder if you can tell us more about why because it would set — the president i ’ m just don ’ t choose to — an example the president they ’ re not mandatory guidelines they ’ re guidelines they suggest you could wear them you don ’ t have to wear them in fact the director be here if you want to say a couple of word about it you don ’ t — you can if you want you don ’ t have to but what i ’ m really inaudible your decision not to wear one the president but basically it ’ s — it ’ s a voluntary thing say it director he ’ s do a good job dr redfield thank you very much i think i just want to reemphasize — i ’ ve say this before — that we ’ re not defenseless against this virus we have a powerful tool a powerful weapon that be social distance and we ’ ve continue to embrace that with the president ’ s initiatives to slow the spread of coronavirus we ’ re constantly look at new data and as the surgeon general say one of the new information that become more clear to all of us be there ’ s a greater number of people that be asymptomatically infect than we previously think as ambassador birx say that may be inversely relate to age and so really the purpose here be first and foremost to embrace the social distance that ’ s the number one thing that ’ s the powerful weapon and you know this virus have a great weakness it can ’ t jump from one person to another if it ’ s get to swim more than six feet and this be why we really want that that say we now know that there may be individuals in signif — areas of significant community transmission that may be asymptomatically infect and we know that a face barrier can actually interrupt the number of virus particles that can go from one person to the other so as be say by the vice president this be — and the president — the purpose of this face cover be to be another adjunctive mitigation strategy to protect someone from spread the virus from themselves to someone else the president and i be just test also so i assume i don ’ t know have the virus so i don ’ t have to worry about spread it okay please go ahead mr president i want to make sure we ’ re clear when you mention tariff earlier — the president yeah — that come up in a meet be you consider tariff on saudi arabian oil and then also — the president well i can always consider — look tariff have make a tremendous amount of money for our country i put them on china i put them on other place and other countries tariff us and they take advantage of us and they have for many years look countries have take advantage of the unite state for years they ’ ve rip us off like nobody can even believe whether it be on — on manufacture whether it be on export whether it be on almost anything include military where we provide virtually free military assistance to countries that frankly take advantage of us don ’ t even like us okay so this have be go on for years they tariff us they create artificial — you could say nonfinancial barriers which be worse than financial barriers you can ’ t sell your product you can ’ t take care of our farmers they win ’ t take our — and yet they ’ ll take us and sell into us and we win ’ t charge them anything for do it look they ’ ve take advantage of us for years tariff be a way of even the score tariff be a way of just neutralize they have tariff on us and we now can put tariff on them be i use it for oil it ’ s something we can no — be i do it now no be i think about impose it as of this moment no but if we ’ re not treat fairly it ’ s certainly a tool in the toolbox and what about with russia be you — would you consider maybe lift sanction or give some sanction relief if they — the president well it would be the same thing no it would be the same thing they be have a dispute — the two countries — and it ’ s hurt the rest of the world because it ’ s really hurt the energy industry russia be be hurt unbelievably badly and saudi arabia be be hurt unbelievably badly because oil and gas be a primary — that ’ s where they get most of their income and this be a price like from the all right it ’ s a price from the they be be hurt very badly i think they ’ re go to settle their dispute pretty quickly why — on the oil why do you think you haven ’ t be more successful on get them to raise the price the president go ahead please why — why do you think you haven ’ t be more successful in get them to increase production in russia and saudi arabia if inaudible the president well they have increase production that ’ s what they ’ ve do they ’ ve increase it so much that there ’ s so — you mean the opposite the president i mean — yeah why do you think you haven ’ t be successful in inaudible increase production the president yeah look look just so — well they ’ re go to stop because the market ultimately the market be go to get them to stop but they both do the opposite they increase production to a level that water be right now more valuable than oil who would have ever think right you have relationships with — the president you go to — you go to some of these kingdoms water be far more valuable than oil there ’ s so much oil it ’ s a tribute in a way inaudible the president but what happen be there be a lot to start off with and then you have the virus and it knock the hell out of the market it — in term of demand so there ’ s no demand and there ’ s tremendous supply so i mean you saw number where it be down to and down frankly below it be even below it ’ s an incredible thing the market but ultimately the marketplace will take care of it but i think they ’ re go to work out their problem fairly quickly okay go ahead mr president — thank you mr president we ’ re already talk about phase four of a stimulus right but you and pelosi and mcconnell be already talk about different things that should be in it now last time people be tell me that the fact that you wouldn ’ t talk to pelosi be an impediment and it really slow things down be you — the president i ’ d talk — if it be important to talk to her i ’ d talk to her be you go to talk to her during the — the president if it be important for the american people i ’ d talk to her but other than that i can have other people talk to her look you ready infrastructure be a great thing for me i think infrastructure for this country — we have an old break infrastructure fifty years ago we be the envy of the world and then we spend all this money so stupidly in the middle east we spend — it ’ s go to be very close to trillion in the middle east how stupid be that decision but they spend it on that and other things we ’ ve get to fix our infrastructure but pelosi be already downplay — the president that mean roads highways tunnel airports everything we get to fix our infra — but pelosi be already kind of downplay — the president and the beauty be because of the fact that we be so strong as a country we ’ re borrow at zero we never have a chance to borrow at zero even in this country we ’ d never have a chance to borrow at zero we ’ re go borrow — this be a great time so we can fix our infrastructure and we ’ ll have almost no interest cost this be the time to do it steve one more question the death total projection that you share with us earlier this week be we still on the current trajectory for that or have social distance — the president which trajec — which one i have many trajectories for many things the — to to be we still on that trajectory or have we make any improvements or maybe not enough time have pass the president say — say it say it steve what have we make enough improvements the president on what on what on social distance have the model change have the model change the president i ’ d have to ask dr fauci and i ’ d have — have to ask deborah have the model change dr birx so a lot of the projections you can see be base on — there ’ s many different ways to look at this and as we discuss on sunday some of it be base on the current global experience we be about i think or time the size of italy a different factor in spain and we look at all of those — what their projections be where they be currently and where that be go and so a lot of the work be base on how this virus have move through other populations that ’ s a very direct way to see how the virus be impact a population there ’ s also terrific model and so every day and every night one of the model that actually look at the model relate to mortality be the healthdataorg data and they update it every night and you can see where we be in that projection i think in the last run of that model they be at or something in the model now all of that can be change by our behaviors and so — and all of it can be change in a different way if we don ’ t follow those behaviors if another major metropolitan area end up have an epidemic like the new york metro area that could dramatically change not the model but the reality of the impact of this virus on americans and where be the model on — the president and by the way the model show hundreds of thousands of people be go to die you know what i want to do i want to come away under the model the professionals do the model i be never involve in a model but — at least this kind of a model but you know what hundreds of thousands of people they say be go to die i want much less than that i want none but it ’ s too late for that but i want very few people relative to what the model be say those be projections i hope they ’ re wrong i hope we ’ re go to be under those projections mr president two question on continuity of government for — the president how come you always have two why can ’ t you have one well they ’ re relate the president every time “ i have three question i have two question can you give me one instead because we have a couple of other people go ahead okay i ’ ll go with my second one the governor of wisconsin be now talk about delay the primary at least not have inperson vote so my question be — and i ask this a couple weeks ago i want to see if you ’ ve make any progress on this look ahead to the fall be you take step to ensure that the general election will happen even if this pandemic have reemerged or hasn ’ t go away and — the president the general election will happen on november and do you — be you — the president in wisconsin what happen be i through social media — media put out a very strong endorsement of a republican conservative judge who ’ s an excellent brilliant judge he ’ s a justice and i hear what happen be his poll number go through the roof and because of that i think they delay the election you don ’ t think the governor be concern about people go to inperson vote the president i don ’ t know why didn ’ t he do it before he be do right before the election but do you think every — the president excuse me why didn ’ t he do this two weeks ago all of a sudden — but isn ’ t it — because of the pandemic the president excuse me all of a sudden an election which be take place very soon get delay now i just endorse him today and it be a very strong endorsement his poll — he ’ s go very high up and all of a sudden the governor come out — the democrat governor by the way — come out and say “ oh we ’ re go to move this election so i don ’ t know i ’ m sure — i hope you ’ re right i hope you ’ re right but — but do you think every state in this country should be prepare for mailin vote in case we ’ re in a situation — the president no because i think a lot of people cheat with mailin vote i think people should vote with id — voter id i think voter id be very important and the reason they don ’ t want voter id be because they intend to cheat when you get something when you buy something you look at your card and credit card and different card — you have your picture on many of them not all of them but on many of them you should have a picture on your — on your — for vote it should be call “ voter id they should have that and it shouldn ’ t be mailin — but how be you go to — the president excuse me it shouldn ’ t be mailin vote it should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself you don ’ t send it in the mail where people pick up — all sort of bad things can happen by the time they sign that if they sign that — if they sign that by the time it get in and be tabulate no it shouldn ’ t be mail in you should vote at the booth and you should have voter id because when you have voter id that ’ s the real deal thank you very much we ’ ll see you tomorrow en pm edt</td>\n",

 it’s a great honor to be with the world leaders in american oil and gas and really i could say the world leaders period when it comes to energy and american energy  the biggest companies anywhere — anywhere in the world i want to thank secretary of the interior david bernhardt secretary of energy dan brouillette and ambassador robert lighthizer for being here we’re also joined by leader kevin mccarthy senators john cornyn kevin cramer ted cruz and dan sullivan  thank you  these are people that really want to see good energy at the good price with us as well are greg garland of phillips  dave hager of devon energy harold hamm of continental resources jeff hildebrand of hilcorp energy vicki hollub of occidental petroleum mike sommers of the american petroleum institute kelcy warren of energy transfer partners mike wirth of chevron and darren woods of an extremely small company known as exxon mobil  well it’s smaller today than it was four weeks ago — laughter — by about half right  that’s all right  it’ll be better than ever today we’ll discuss the impact of the coronavirus on american energy industry  as the pandemic brought on by global economy — i mean it’s an incredible thing that’s happened  nobody thought this was possible  we had the greatest economy in the world  probably you were doing — all of you — the best ever  everybody was doing the best ever  and then all of a sudden they said “you have to shut down the country” and they have to shut down the world because the whole world is shut down not the country  the whole world is shut down  countries  probably it’s higher than that now  that was as of a week ago so the entire world is shut down trying to get rid of this scourge  and — and we’ll do it i thought what i might do is go around the room and you just introduce yourselves to the media real quickly and then we’ll have a discussion afterwards  you know our  relief package includes provisions to allow businesses to deduct their losses this year against taxes they paid in previous years which gets you a lot of liquidity  and a lot of companies need the liquidity right now and hopefully we’re going to be back in business very soon  we’re going to be open very soon  this country wasn’t built to be closed  and essentially we have a closed country  nobody has ever heard of a thing like this but this was — i was with some of the leading professionals and they say not since  has there been anything like this   was a time when i guess you could say   or  million — you hear different estimates — people died  think of that  million  maybe  million people died  so they had no communications  they weren’t able to shut things down like we are doing but that was a — that was a plague  that was a plague  it started here actually  it went to europe  we were badly affected but europe was really affected  so that was the worst so not since  years ago — more than  years ago has this — a thing like this happened i just want to start by saying it’s an honor to be with you  i know most of you one way or the other  some of you i know and — but i know all of you by seeing you on the covers of all the business magazines and the magazines  and you’ve done a great job and we’ll work this out and we’ll get our energy business back  i’m with you  percent  it’s a great business  it’s a very vital business  and honestly you’ve been very fair  you’ve kept energy prices reasonable for a long period of time  we’ve got a long period of time with very reasonable energy prices so i want to thank you all for being here  and maybe we’ll start with mike  please mr wirth  all right  mike wirth with chevron corporation mr president  i’m proud of the work our people are doing to support healthcare providers first responders and all the other vital industries that keep our economy going thank you for having us the president  thank you mike very much  appreciate it ms hollub  vicki hollub of occidental petroleum the president  hi vicki ms hollub  thank you for allowing us to be here today and thank you for all you’re doing for us the president  thank you very much  thank you vicki mr hager  dave hager with devon energy  we’re an independent oil and gas company out of oklahoma city  and thank you so much for the leadership that you’re providing during this challenging time  and we — you’re the right man at the right time to balance all the priorities  and we’re going to be back  thank you very much the president  we’ll get it done dave  thank you very much mr garland  mr president i’m greg garland phillips   again thank you for your great leadership through this pandemic crisis and all that you’ve done on the stimulus package really for the american economy  i’m proud of our employees  they’re working to provide energy and improve lives the president  we think it’s going to come back quickly  it’s — it’s ready  we’re ready  and we’ve got the right packages out there  so — mr garland  we need it too the president  very good  we’re looking at a — i think we’re going to be really looking very seriously at a infrastructure package where — it’s so important for our country you know as of this moment darren we have  trillionplus in the middle east  for what  for what reason  and we don’t put money in our own country  so we’re going to do a big — a big package on infrastructure fairly soon i think and that’s very important  and it’s great for you great for everybody darren please mr woods  thank you mr president  darren woods exxon mobil corporation  i’d like to add my thanks for your leadership in this space as well and say i think all of our companies here align with your objective which is to get the economy moving and to make people’s lives around the world better the president  good  great job you’ve done  thank you mr hamm  harold hamm chairman of continental resources also out of oklahoma city  thanks for having this meeting  i think this is so timely and necessary  really appreciate your leadership also the friendship that you’ve kept with the saudis — the saudi crown minister — or crown prince and also vladimir putin  i know those haven’t been easy sometimes but at this time it was particularly needed so i represent our company as well as depa — domestic energy producers alliance  and we’re about  companies and individuals — mostly independent producers the president  that’s great  great job you’re doing i think president putin and the crown prince want something to happen badly  certainly terrible for them what’s happening too  so they want to see something happen  i’ve spoken to both of them and we’ll tell you about that in a little while  okay thank you very much mr hildebrand  thank you mr president  jeff hildebrand founder and chairman hilcorp energy  our distinction is we are the only private company here  this is a company that’s based in houston domesticonly exploration and production company and i’m really here today to represent the independent energy companies the familyowned businesses that are in this industry and to give you really that perspective and add to the conversation in that regard the president  good  that’s great mr hildebrand  so thank you for your leadership the president  thank you mr hildebrand  appreciate it the president  great job  thank you mr hildebrand  you bet mr warren  thank you mr president  kelcy warren energy transfer  we’re the only pipeline company  and so we try to do business with everybody in this room and i think we successfully do actually  so it’s an honor to be here sir and it’s an honor to be in this room with these folks as well the president  and everyone loves that guy right  we all do  thank you very much kelcy  great  great job you’re doing too he’s not an oil and gas man  he’s a wonderful person and a wonderful politician and he wants to see the industry get strong again  so kevin do you have anything to say by the way leader mccarthy  well first i want to thank you for doing this  just by you reaching out to president putin and the crown prince things have improved  you’re looking around at a lot of jobs but what else you’re not seeing at this table a lot of these are small businesses that work with all these individuals around here  and your action today with signing the cares act getting the smallbusiness loans out is going very strongly — the president  yeah leader mccarthy  — because it’s needed the president  it’s doing well leader mccarthy  but the american economy — the greatest strength is our — what energy provides us  you provide us at a good price  these are great jobs  but more importantly it also gives us energy independence  it changes the whole dynamics around the world and so i thank you for the leadership and what you’re doing the president  thank you kevin  and as you just said the bank of america in particular has really — of the big banks — has really stepped into it  they have done a fantastic job  today it’s over — leader mccarthy  ten thousand in the first two hours the president  yeah  bank of america has been unbelievable  and i want to thank them  i want to thank all of the community banks and the smaller banks that have been loaning a lot of money — paycheck  it’s all about the paycheck  and that — nobody would have believed it could have gone so well so it’s — it’s just a number of hours  but the numbers are far greater than we would have anticipated  so it’s been really great and thank you to all the banks but again in particular bank of america  they really stepped right up and they did it  there were no big deals  they weren’t making a big deal out of anything  so that was terrific and i think what we want to do — john cornyn please  i know how you are so involved in this coming from the great state of texas  would you like to say a couple of words john senator cornyn  thank you mr president  thank you for convening the meeting  many of us have been talking together but we can’t get done what needs to be done  only you and the administration can  and particularly getting the attention of the saudis and flooding the markets really adding insult to injury in a time when on our economy was suffering anyway because of the coronavirus  and so this meeting could not be more timely i agree with what’s been said about the importance of affordable energy to our standard of living  and really we’ve changed the — changed the world as a result of the production of domestic energy here and improved the quality of life for a lot of people the president  thanks very much john  really good job  and john agrees — we were talking about it the other day — that you’ve all done well but you’ve also kept energy very affordable really  very very affordable and very — a lot of it  we never had any problems  and we’re going to keep it that way do i see dan back there  dan senator sullivan  yes sir mr president  laughter the president  i was looking — i thought that looked like dan senator sullivan  i want to thank you for convening this meeting  you know under the trump administration working with the congress the us has become the world’s energy superpower again  it’s unbelievable  and these companies have done it  obviously it’s a very important issue in my state the great state of alaska  but these are great jobs as john cornyn just said for all of our states  but it’s really important for the national security of our country too and we have been — a number of senators have been reaching out having frank discussions with the saudis saying “hey if you’re a longstanding ally of ours we’re not — right now you’re hurting a lot of our citizens  you’re hurting a lot of the people we represent and shouldn’t take us for granted” we have a great military that’s protected saudi arabia for decades  and senator cramer and i have some legislation that could possibly change that if they don’t start cooperating so again we appreciate your leadership with the crown prince with the russians in calling this meeting but this is a great sector of the us economy that once we get through this and we will — of this pandemic this –this sector is going to take off again  and your — your administration and you have had a lot to do with the strength of the us energy sector  and we need to keep it strong the president  thank you very much dan and kevin cramer north dakota  people don’t realize how big a producer north dakota is  right senator cramer  well harold knows  laughter senator cornyn  harold knows senator cramer  it sort of allows the others inaudible the president  harold — harold knows that’s for sure senator cramer  mr president to echo everything and maybe add a little bit the people around your cabinet table right now are part of the renaissance of oil and gas in this country  but since you became president we went from a renaissance to security to independence to dominance  and that dominance and that security are — right now are in some danger just a quick example in north dakota since saudi arabia and russia announced their little price war we’ve had  billion of cutbacks taken out of our state planned for this year the president  yeah senator cramer  i was economic development director when the entire gross domestic product of north dakota was  billion  so that’s significant  that represents not just capex that represents lots of jobs lots of people in the value chain and i would just add one word to what dan talked about with regard to saudi arabia  it is estimated by one report in  that we spent a minimum of  billion defending global oil supplies  we can use that money in national defense and other hotspots in the world if our friends are going to treat us this way so i appreciate your outreach this week  i think we’re halfway there just with the success of your diplomacy this week  thank you for this meeting the president  well it’s gone up  it’s gone up  and we have to  otherwise we do — we lose a lot of jobs too  we’re talking about one of the big job producers anywhere kevin right would you have anything to say mr sommers  mr president thank you  i’m mike sommers  i’m president and ceo of the american petroleum institute  the folks around this table represent the american energy revolution and we want to thank you for everything that you’ve done to support that revolution  and we want to make sure that revolution continues — the president  right mr sommers  — after this pandemic crisis is solved the president  thank you mike mr sommers  thank you sir the president  thank you  very good leader mccarthy  i think senator cruz was somewhere — the president  i think he’s around here leader mccarthy  right back there  ted can’t be seen the president  where — where is senator cruz participant  he’s hiding behind the press  laughter the president  i can’t believe it  he’s gone — he’s gone over to the evil side  laughter  that’s terrible cruz what are you doing there senator cruz  mr president thank you for convening this meeting  this is an important meeting and this is the time as you know of crisis all across the country — a public health crisis and an economic crisis as you’ve heard and as you know from everyone around this table the energy sector has been a huge part of the economic success and boom that we’ve enjoyed over the last several years  and the combination of the economic harm of the coronavirus crisis combined with the saudis and russians waging economic warfare on jobs in this country it’s been a perfect storm in the energy sector and i’ll tell you there are a lot of jobs — there are millions of jobs in texas and across the country that are represented by the men and women around this table and by energy producers  and there are small producers throughout texas and throughout the country who are — who are on the verge of being driven out of business and so this — this meeting i think is important  every one of the senators in this room has had multiple conversations with the saudis leaning in hard on the saudis  and your leadership and diplomacy with the crown prince had a big impact getting them to stop flooding the market and taking advantage of this crisis and i would underscore one other issue that a number of the folks around this table have raised and i’m very concerned about is ensuring that those in energy in this time of crisis have access to capital  that — there are jobs that are hanging in the balance  and if the energy producers in this country that have made america the number one producer of oil and gas in the world can’t access capital to get out of this crisis we’re going to see bankruptcies at a level this country hasn’t seen in decades and so this meeting and the continued leadership of your administration is hugely important  thank you the president  good  thank you very much ted  and while you’re up the concept and for instance — i think we should say it in front of the media — but oil reserves storing oil  we’re filling up the national reserves as you know  we’re getting the oil at a great price but at these prices — in fact kevin and i have been speaking about it john and i have been speaking about it — at these prices you would think you’d want to fill up every cavity that we have in this country  and there’s some areas in louisiana and other areas that could be filled up they hold a lot of oil but at these prices — and it would be good and it would keep everybody working — but you would think you’d want to fill up those areas  what do you think of that ted senator cruz  look i think that’s exactly right  i think it makes sense in terms of easing the pressure that is threatening these jobs  but it also makes sense for the taxpayer the president  yeah senator cruz  that strategic petroleum reserve is there in times of crisis  and usually the way the federal government works is we buy when it’s expensive and we sell when it’s cheap the president  yeah  no it’s — senator cruz  we actually have an opportunity now to buy when it’s cheap  i think it was inexcusable that democratic leadership in the house and senate blocked that in this bill we passed last week  and then i think congress needs to go back and address it leader mccarthy  it was in the bill senator cruz  yep leader mccarthy  and then the speaker came in and that’s the one thing — when she held this bill up for the number of days — that she removed the president  twentydollar oil  think of it leader mccarthy  yeah the president  twenty dollars senator cruz  well and there are too many democrats — the president  it’s politics senator cruz  — that want to see these — the president  it’s all right senator cruz  — jobs go away the president  i think you should go back though kevin  i think you should go back and see john if you guys can go back and do a separate bill and beyond that you know i think it’s  million barrels right now to fill it up  that’s not that much  so it’s fairly in pretty good shape  but we have other areas that are bigger frankly that we can fill up too but at those prices we should be — we should be pumping it out  so maybe you guys can check on it and see what you can do about it  i don’t think anyone can reject it  nobody can reject it  ted you’ll work on that senator cruz  absolutely the president  anybody else  david you guys okay  david you want to say something secretary bernhardt  so just one thing mr president  the department of the interior manages a large portion of land and part of the offshore  and one of the things we have done over the last  days as you had the “slow the spread” we have really had our inspectors out on the frontlines working to make sure that the production that’s taking place is occurring in a safe and a responsible manner and i thank everybody for their cooperation in that these jobs are so important to the american people and it’s important that we make sure that we dot our i’s and cross our t’s too

of energy  with regard to the storage mr president i’m happy to announce we went to market this week for  million barrels  notwithstanding the — the desire of the congress not to give us new money to pursue this idea we have found an alternative financing mechanism — the president  good secretary brouillette  — so that we can immediately find — the president  i figured you would  laughter  i actually wasn’t worried about it  laughter secretary brouillette  — so that can we can find — the president  what are you paying per barrel secretary brouillette  i’m sorry sir the president  what are

than ever today we ’ ll discus the impact of the coronavirus on american energy industry a the pandemic brought on by global economy — i mean it ’ s an incredible thing that ’ s happened nobody thought this wa possible we had the greatest economy in the world probably you were doing — all of you — the best ever everybody wa doing the best ever and then all of a sudden they said “ you have to shut down the country ” and they have to shut down the world because the whole world is shut down not the country the whole world is shut down country probably it ’ s higher than that now that wa a of a week ago so the entire world is shut down trying to get rid of this scourge and — and we ’ ll do it i thought what i might do is go around the room and you just introduce yourselves to the medium real quickly and then we ’ ll have a discussion afterwards you know our relief package includes provision to allow business to deduct their loss this year against tax they paid in previous year which get you a lot of liquidity and a lot of company need the liquidity right now and hopefully we ’ re going to be back in business very soon we ’ re going to be open very soon this country wasn ’ t built to be closed and essentially we have a closed country nobody ha ever heard of a thing like this but this wa — i wa with some of the leading professional and they say not since ha there been anything like this wa a time when i guess you could say or million — you hear different estimate — people died think of that million maybe million people died so they had no communication they weren ’ t able to shut thing down like we are doing but that wa a — that wa a plague that wa a plague it started here actually it went to europe we were badly affected but europe wa really affected so that wa the

thanks for having this meeting i think this is so timely and necessary really appreciate your leadership also the friendship that you ’ ve kept with the saudi — the saudi crown minister — or crown prince and also vladimir putin i know those haven ’ t been easy sometimes but at this time it wa particularly needed so i represent our company a well a depa — domestic energy producer alliance and we ’ re about company and individual — mostly independent producer the president that ’ s great great job you ’ re doing i think president putin and the crown prince want something to happen badly certainly terrible for them what ’ s happening too so they want to see something happen i ’ ve spoken to both of them and we ’ ll tell you about that in a little while okay thank you very much mr hildebrand thank you mr president jeff hildebrand founder and chairman hilcorp energy our distinction is we are the only private company here this is a company that ’ s based in houston domesticonly exploration and production company and i ’ m really here today to represent the independent energy company the familyowned business that are in this industry and to give you really that perspective and add to the conversation in that regard the president good that ’ s great mr hildebrand so thank you for your leadership the president thank you mr hildebrand appreciate it the president great job thank you mr hildebrand you bet mr warren thank you mr president kelcy warren energy transfer we ’ re the only pipeline company and so we try to do business with everybody in this room and i think we successfully do actually so it ’ s an honor to be here sir and it ’ s an honor to be in this room with these folk a well the president and everyone love that guy right we all do thank you very much kelcy great great job you ’ re doing too he ’ s not an oil and gas man he ’ s a wonderful person and a wonderful politician and he want to see the industry get strong again so kevin do you have anything to say by the way leader mccarthy well first i want to thank you for doing this just by you reaching out to president putin and the crown prince thing have improved you ’ re looking around at a lot of job but what else you ’ re not seeing at this table a lot of these are small business that work with all these individual around here and your action today with signing the care act getting the smallbusiness loan out is going very strongly — the president yeah leader mccarthy — because it ’ s needed the president it ’ s doing well leader mccarthy but the american economy — the greatest strength is our — what energy provides u you provide u at a good price these are great job but more importantly it also give u energy independence it change the whole dynamic around the world and so i thank you for the leadership and what you ’ re doing the president thank you kevin and a you just said the bank of america in particular ha really — of the big bank — ha really stepped into it they have done a fantastic job today it ’ s over — leader mccarthy ten thousand in the first two hour the president yeah bank of america ha been unbelievable and i want to thank them i want to thank all of the community bank and the smaller bank that have been loaning a lot of money — paycheck it ’ s all about the paycheck and that — nobody would have believed it could have gone so well so it ’ s — it ’ s just a number of hour but the number are far greater than we would have anticipated so it ’ s been really great and thank you to all the bank but again in particular bank of america they really stepped right up and they did it there were no big deal they weren ’ t making a big deal out of anything so that wa terrific and i think what we want to do — john cornyn please i know how you are so involved in this coming from the great state of texas would you like to say a couple of word john senator cornyn thank you mr president thank you for convening the meeting many of u have been talking together but we can ’ t get done what need to be done only you and the administration can and particularly getting the attention of the saudi and flooding the market really adding insult to injury in a time when on our economy wa suffering anyway because of the coronavirus and so this meeting could not be more timely i agree with what ’ s been said about the importance of affordable energy to our standard of living and really we ’ ve changed the — changed the world a a result of the production of domestic energy here and improved the quality of life for a lot of people the president thanks very much john really good job and john agrees — we were talking about it the other day — that you ’ ve all done well but you ’ ve also kept energy very affordable really very very affordable and very — a lot of it we never had any problem and we ’ re going to keep it that way do i see dan back there dan senator sullivan yes sir mr president laughter the president i wa looking — i thought that looked like dan senator sullivan i want to thank you for convening this meeting you know under the trump administration working with the congress the u ha become the world ’ s energy superpower again it ’ s unbelievable and these company have done it obviously it ’ s a very important issue in my state the great state of alaska but these are great job a john cornyn just said for all of our state but it ’ s really important for the national security of our country too and we have been — a number of senator have been reaching out having frank discussion with the saudi saying “ hey if you ’ re a longstanding ally of ours we ’ re not — right now you ’ re hurting a lot of our citizen you ’ re hurting a lot of the people we represent and shouldn ’ t take u for granted ” we have a great military that ’ s protected saudi arabia for decade and senator cramer and i have some legislation that could possibly change that if they don ’ t start cooperating so again we appreciate your leadership with the crown prince with the russian in calling this meeting but this is a great sector of the u economy that once we get through this and we will — of this pandemic this –this sector is going to take off again and your — your administration and you have had a lot to do with the strength of the u energy sector and we need to keep it strong the president thank you very much dan and kevin cramer north dakota people don ’ t realize how big a producer north dakota is right senator cramer well harold know laughter senator cornyn harold know senator cramer it sort of allows the others inaudible the president harold — harold know that ’ s for sure senator cramer mr president to echo everything and maybe add a little bit the people around your cabinet table right now are part of the renaissance of oil and gas in this country but since you became president we went from a renaissance to security to independence to dominance and that dominance and that security are — right now are in some danger just a quick example in north dakota since saudi arabia and russia announced their little price war we ’ ve had billion of cutback taken out of our state planned for this year the president yeah senator cramer i wa economic development director when the entire gross domestic product of north dakota wa billion so that ’ s significant that represents not just capex that represents lot of job lot of people in the value chain and i would just add one word to what dan talked about with regard to saudi arabia it is estimated by one report in that we spent a minimum of billion defending global oil supply we can use that money in national defense and other hotspot in the world if our friend are going to treat u this way so i appreciate your outreach this week i think we ’ re halfway there just with the success of your diplomacy this week thank you for this meeting the president well it ’ s gone up it ’ s gone up and we have to otherwise we do — we lose a lot of job too we ’ re talking about one of the big job producer anywhere kevin right would you have anything to say mr sommers mr president thank you i ’ m mike sommers i ’ m president and ceo of the american petroleum institute the folk around this table represent the american energy revolution and we want to thank you for everything that you ’ ve done to support that revolution and we want to make sure that revolution continues — the president right mr sommers — after this pandemic crisis is solved the president thank you mike mr sommers thank you sir the president thank you very good leader mccarthy i think senator cruz wa somewhere — the president i think he ’ s around here leader mccarthy right back there ted can ’ t be seen the president where — where is senator cruz participant he ’ s hiding behind the press laughter the president i can ’ t believe it he ’ s gone — he ’ s gone over to the evil side laughter that ’ s terrible cruz what are you doing there senator cruz mr president thank you for convening this meeting this is an important meeting and this is the time a you know of crisis all across the country — a public health crisis and an economic crisis a you ’ ve heard and a you know from everyone around this table the energy sector ha been a huge part of the economic success and boom that we ’ ve enjoyed over the last several year and the combination of the economic harm of the coronavirus crisis combined with the saudi and russian waging economic warfare on job in this country it ’ s been a perfect storm in the energy sector and i ’ ll tell you there are a lot of job — there are million of job in texas and across the country that are represented by the men and woman around this table and by energy producer and there are small producer throughout texas and throughout the country who are — who are on the verge of being driven out of business and so this — this meeting i think is important every one of the senator in this room ha had multiple conversation with the saudi leaning in hard on the saudi and your leadership and diplomacy with the crown prince had a big impact getting them to stop flooding the market and taking advantage

hugely important thank you the president good thank you very much ted and while you ’ re up the concept and for instance — i think we should say it in front of the medium — but oil reserve storing oil we ’ re filling up the national reserve a you know we ’ re getting the oil at a great price but at these price — in fact kevin and i have been speaking about it john and i have been speaking about it — at these price you would think you ’ d want to fill up every cavity that we have in this country and there ’ s some area in louisiana and other area that could be filled up they hold a lot of oil

saudis and flood the market really add insult to injury in a time when on our economy be suffer anyway because of the coronavirus and so this meet could not be more timely i agree with what ’ s be say about the importance of affordable energy to our standard of live and really we ’ ve change the — change the world as a result of the production of domestic energy here and improve the quality of life for a lot of people the president thank very much john really good job and john agree — we be talk about it the other day — that you ’ ve all do well but you ’ ve also keep energy very affordable

’ s energy superpower again it ’ s unbelievable and these company have do it obviously it ’ s a very important issue in my state the great state of alaska but these be great job as john cornyn just say for all of our state but it ’ s really important for the national security of our country too and we have be — a number of senators have be reach out have frank discussions with the saudis say “ hey if you ’ re a longstanding ally of ours we ’ re not — right now you ’ re hurt a lot of our citizens you ’ re hurt a lot of the people we represent and shouldn ’ t take us for grant ” we have a great military that ’ s protect saudi arabia for decades and senator cramer and i have some legislation that could possibly change that if they don ’ t start cooperate so again we appreciate your leadership with the crown prince with the russians in call this meet but this be a great sector of the us economy that once we get through this and we will — of this pandemic this –this sector be go to take off again and your — your administration and you have have a lot to do with the strength of the us energy sector and we need to keep it strong the president thank you very much dan and kevin cramer north dakota people don ’ t realize how big a producer north dakota be right senator cramer well harold know laughter senator cornyn harold know senator cramer it sort of allow the others inaudible the president harold — harold know that ’ s for sure senator cramer mr president to echo everything and maybe add a little bite the people around your cabinet table right now be part of the renaissance of oil and gas in this country but since you become president we go from a renaissance to security to independence to dominance and that dominance and that security be — right now be in some danger just a quick example in north dakota since saudi arabia and russia announce their little price war we ’ ve have billion of cutbacks take out of our state plan for this year the president yeah senator cramer i be economic development director when the entire gross domestic product of north dakota be billion so that ’ s significant that represent not just capex that represent lot of job lot of people in the value chain and i would just add one word to what dan talk about with regard to saudi arabia it be estimate by one report in that we spend a minimum of billion defend global oil supply we can use that money in national defense and other hotspots in the world if our friends be go to treat us this way so i appreciate your outreach this week i think we ’ re halfway there just with the success of your diplomacy this week thank you for this meet the president well it ’ s go up it ’ s go up and we have to otherwise we do — we lose a lot of job too we ’ re talk about one of the big job producers anywhere kevin right would you have anything to say mr sommers mr president thank you i ’ m mike sommers i ’ m president and ceo of the american petroleum institute the folks around this table represent the american energy revolution and we want to thank you for everything that you ’ ve do to support that revolution and we want to make sure that revolution continue — the president right mr sommers — after this pandemic crisis be solve the president thank you mike mr sommers thank you sir the president thank you very good leader mccarthy i think senator cruz be somewhere — the president i think he ’ s around here leader mccarthy right back there ted can ’ t be see the president where — where be senator cruz participant he ’ s hide behind the press laughter the president i can ’ t believe it he ’ s go — he ’ s go over to the evil side laughter that ’ s terrible cruz what be you do there senator cruz mr president thank you for convene this meet this be an important meet and this be the time as you know of crisis all across the country — a public health crisis and an economic crisis as you ’ ve hear and as you know from everyone around this table the energy sector have be a huge part of the economic success and boom that we ’ ve enjoy over the last several years and the combination of the economic harm of the coronavirus crisis combine with the saudis and russians wag economic warfare on job in this country it ’ s be a perfect storm in the energy sector and i ’ ll tell you there be a lot of job — there be millions of job in texas and across the country that be represent by the men and women around this table and by energy producers and there be small producers throughout texas and throughout the country who be — who be on the verge of be drive out of business and so this — this meet i think be important every one of the senators in this room have have multiple conversations with the saudis lean in hard on the saudis and your leadership and diplomacy with the crown prince have a big impact get them to stop flood the market and take advantage of this crisis and i would underscore one other issue that a number of the folks around this table have raise and i ’ m very concern about be ensure that those in energy in this time of crisis have access to capital that — there be job that be hang in the balance and if the energy producers in this country that have make america the number one producer of oil and gas in the world can ’ t access capital to get out of this crisis we ’ re go to see bankruptcies at a level this country hasn ’ t see in decades and so this meet and the continue leadership of your administration be hugely important thank you the president good thank you very much ted and while you ’ re up the concept and for instance — i think we should say it in front of the media — but oil reserve store oil we ’ re fill up the national reserve as you know we ’ re get the oil at a great price but at these price — in fact kevin and i have be speak about it john and i have be speak about it — at these price you would think you ’ d want to fill up every cavity that we have in this country and there ’ s some areas in louisiana and other areas that could be fill up they hold a lot of oil but at these price — and it would be good and it would keep everybody work — but you would think you ’ d want to fill up those areas what do you think of that ted senator cruz look i think that ’ s exactly right i think it make sense in term of ease the pressure that be threaten these job but it also make sense for the taxpayer the president yeah senator cruz that strategic petroleum reserve be there in time of crisis and usually the way the federal government work be we buy when it ’ s expensive and we sell when it ’ s cheap the president yeah no it ’ s — senator cruz we actually have an opportunity now to buy when it ’ s cheap i think it be inexcusable that democratic leadership in the house and senate block that in this bill we pass last week and then i think congress need to go back and address it leader mccarthy it be in the bill senator cruz yep leader mccarthy and then the speaker come in and that ’ s the one thing — when she hold this bill up for the number of days — that she remove the president twentydollar oil think of it leader mccarthy yeah the president twenty dollars senator cruz well and there be too many democrats — the president it ’ s politics senator cruz — that want to see these — the president it ’ s all right senator cruz — job go away the president i think you should go back though kevin i think you should go back and see john if you guy can go back and do a separate bill and beyond that you know i think it ’ s million barrel right now to fill it up that ’ s not that much so it ’ s fairly in pretty good shape but we have other areas that be bigger frankly that we can fill up too but at those price we should be — we should be pump it out so maybe you guy can check on it and see what you can do about it i don ’ t think anyone can reject it nobody can reject it ted you ’ ll work on that senator cruz absolutely the president anybody else david you guy okay david you want to say something secretary bernhardt so just one thing mr president the department of the interior manage a large portion of land and part of the offshore and one of the things we have

president  okay  thank you very much  good to be with you all  we’re in a very critical phase of our war against the coronavirus  it’s vital that every american follows our guidelines on the “ days to slow the spread  the sacrifices we make over the next four weeks will have countless american lives saved  we’re going to save a lot of american lives  and we’re in control of our own fate very much so  maintaining social distance practicing vigorous hygiene and staying at home are your most effective ways to win the war and to escape danger while you’re fighting this battle from home we’re working with the best scientists doctors and researchers anywhere in the world  we’re racing to develop new ways to protect against the virus as well as therapies treatments and ultimately a vaccine  and we’re making a lot of progress  i think medically a lot of progress at the same time we’re also racing to get relief to american workers and small businesses as you know  i want to remind smallbusiness owners across america that the paycheck protection program is launching tomorrow  nearly  billion in loans will be available to small businesses including sole proprietors  these loans are up to  percent forgivable as long as employers keep paying their workers  got to take care of your workers furthermore we want social security beneficiaries to know that if they are typically not required to file a tax return they don’t have to file one in order to receive the direct cash payments that will soon be distributed to american citizens  the treasury will deposit the money directly into the bank accounts  and don’t forget i will always protect your social security your medicare and your medicaid  we’re protecting social security medicare and medicaid and i always will i’d like now to invite sba administrator jovita carranza who’s doing a fantastic job — she’s going to be very busy in the next little while — and secretary steve mnuchin to say a few words about these vital initiatives  and then we’ll get on to the attack of the virus itself and please if i might steve and jovita administrator carranza  thank you  thank you mr president and mr vice president secretary mnuchin ivanka trump and all who i have been working closely with in this effort  small business is the backbone of the american economy and the president has put the nation’s  million small businesses front and center in the response effort and we are working hard to get money to them quickly this is an unprecedented effort by this administration to support small businesses and we know that there will be challenges in the process  secretary mnuchin and i are working in tandem to ensure that feedback from our partners is being heard and implemented the private and public sector must work closely together to ensure that small businesses and their workers across the country are put first  this administration believes wholeheartedly that if you are a small business you are a critical part of the economic fabric of this country  and your viability is critical to the economic wellbeing of your employees at sba we are working around the clock to support small businesses ensuring that we are prioritizing emergency capital for small businesses that are suffering economic harm as a result of this unprecedented situation this relief will help stabilize a small business sector by providing businesses with the financial resources they need to keep their workers employed and keep up with their daytoday operating expenses today i want to ensure that small businesses all over the country know about the paycheck protection program and how they can benefit from this  simply put the paycheck protection program is to help keep employees on payroll and small businesses open  sba will forgive the portion of the loan that is used toward job retention and certain other expenses  we are working closely with lenders so that businesses can go directly to their local lenders the paycheck protection program is in addition to substantial work that the sba has and will continue to do to help small businesses including providing advances on sba disaster loans and forgiving existing sba loan payments over the next six months additional details on these critically important programs can be found at sbagov  and we will be updating these resources regularly our hearts go out to those affected by this terrible virus  our communities around the country are stepping up and we will get through this together at sba we know that every phone call email or application submitted has a smallbusiness owner their employees and the communities they support around the other side  our most important objective is to allow small businesses to keep their employees onboard and keep their businesses viable through this unprecedented disruption i want to reiterate the importance of patience in this process as we work together to ensure that businesses are able to access needed credit  we will continue working around the clock as we’ve done with our federal and private sector partners expanding capacity and working to make our systems as robust as possible to meet the needs thank you mr president the president  thank you jovita  very good  thank you secretary mnuchin  thank you mr president thank you mr vice president and thank you jovita  mr president you’ve made it clear to us we now need to execute  we need to get money to small business and american workers and that’s what we’re doing the sba and treasury committed to get this program up and running tomorrow  and when jovita says people are working around the clock they literally — we had both teams working until  o’clock in the morning and start working again today we’ve heard feedback from lenders community banks regional banks and we spent the last  hours making this system even easier so this will be up and running tomorrow  i encourage all small businesses that have  or fewer people please contact your lenders  any fdic institution will be able to do this any credit union existing sba lenders and fintech lenders you get the money  you’ll get it the same day  you use this to pay your workers  please bring your workers back to work  if you’ve let them go you have eight weeks plus overhead  this is a very important program i’m pleased to announce we are going to raise the interest rate on these loans — and again the interest rate is paid for as part of the program the borrower doesn’t have to pay this — to  percent  we had announced it was going to be  basis points  we’ve heard from some smaller community banks that their deposit costs — even though the government is borrowing at three or four basis points — this is on average a  loan  to make this attractive for community banks we’ve agreed to raise the interest rate again i encourage everybody take out the paycheck protection program i’m also pleased to report the economic impact payments  i had previously said this would take us three weeks  i’m pleased to report that within two weeks the first payments will be direct deposit into taxpayers’ account and as the president said last night the president authorized me to say that anybody that has social security recipients won’t need to file a new tax return and we’ll have that  if we don’t have your direct deposit information we’ll be putting up a web portal so that you can put that up  it is a very large priority  the president has made clear we want to get this money quickly into your hands i’m also pleased to report that we continue to work closely with the federal reserve  we’re in the process of designing a new facility that we call the “main street” lending facility  we’re also looking at facilities for state governments as well and i’m also pleased to report the employee retention credit — it’s up and running  the first  of wages you get a  percent credit that’s  per person  for everyone who’s kept someone you can immediately get that money you can deduct it from what you owe the irs immediately  if you don’t owe us money you’ll get a refundable tax credit  so that is up and running i’m also pleased to report we have the program up and running  we’re taking applications from the airlines from the cargo companies and from national security companies so thank you very much mr president the president  thank you steve  for jovita or steve any questions please    mr secretary chase bank sent a letter to its business clients today saying that they don’t have the necessary guidance from the sba from the treasury department to be able to accept loan applications starting tomorrow  the need is clearly enormous  but at least one major bank says they’re not fully empowered yet to be able to help their customers secretary mnuchin  well as i spoke to all the ceos yesterday — i had a conference call with them — we got very good input from them on what they needed  as i said people were working until  o’clock i believe we just put up the federal register with the new guidelines for lenders  i’ve been assured that the banks will be in the process starting tomorrow now again it’s going to take a little bit of time but we committed that this will be available tomorrow and i encourage all companies go to sbacom sbagov go to treasurygov  you can see the information you need immediately    just to follow up with the smallbusiness owners  a number of them are saying that they were on that conference call and that there’s a tremendous power struggle going on between the treasury and sba and that it’s over process and forms is what they tell me that lenders are actually opting out because they can’t make enough money to even service the loans  so how are you going to make sure these smallbusiness owners get the capital they need to survive right now secretary mnuchin  well first of all i can assure you — jovita is here  jovita used to work for me as the treasurer  there is no power struggle administrator carranza  no secretary mnuchin  jovita and our team as i said worked together until  o’clock in the morning and started working at  o’clock again  we’ve made the form simpler and i can assure you at five points — i’ve told these bankers they should take all their traders and put them in the branches  there’ll never be another opportunity to earn five points on a  government — fully governmentguaranteed loan    and those checks right into direct deposit the irs now saying it would take four to five months you’re saying two weeks  can you give us a solid — secretary mnuchin  well let me be — let me be clear  i don’t know where you’re hearing these things  i told you this would be three weeks  i’m not committing to two weeks  we’re delivering on our commitments the irs which i oversee within two weeks the first money will be in people’s accounts    just to follow up on that i think the question is not about the first checks  for folks who have direct deposit it sounds like those will go out pretty quickly  the question is then for folks who don’t have direct deposit secretary mnuchin  sure    and there was a staff memo that was released by the house ways and means committee today saying that that process could take up to five weeks sic  that takes you to midaugust  is that how long it’s going to take secretary mnuchin  that is not going to take five —    or five months i’m sorry secretary mnuchin  again let me just say when obama sent out these checks it took months and months and months  i am assuring the american public  they need the money now  what we’re going to do is — again if we have your information you’ll get it in two — in — within two weeks  social security you’ll get it very quickly after that  if we don’t have your information you’ll have a simple web portal you’ll upload it  if we don’t have that we’ll send you checks in the mail    how many checks can you process in a week though  how many checks can you — secretary mnuchin  again we can process a lot of checks but we don’t want to send checks  in this environment we don’t want people to get checks  we want to put money directly into their account    thank you mr secretary  this is for i guess both you and the administrator  there have been some anecdotal reports that business people are trying to get access to the online site to submit the applications  the website has been crashing  i’ve heard of webinars going offline because there’s just too many people on them  so how are you guys going to be ready you know tomorrow to get these loans out secretary mnuchin  we’ve brought in a lot of external resources at sba and us to make sure there’s additional capacity  as i said we heard a lot of good feedback yesterday to simplify this process  it’s going to be up and running now let me just be clear that doesn’t mean everybody is going to get their loan tomorrow  but the system will be up and running  we encourage people over the next week sign up  you can go on right now  you can go on the web see what information you need  very simple process    mr secretary on a separate subject have you been in touch with leader mcconnell and speaker pelosi about their differences right now about another stimulus package secretary mnuchin  i spoke to — i’ve spoken to the leader i’ve spoken to the speaker  i’ve spoken to the president constantly  when the president is ready and thinks we should do the next stage we’re ready  the president has talked about the issue of infrastructure since the campaign  i think you know that’s a big priority for him and again if we run out of money on the smallbusiness program we’ll be back right away to congress to get this increased    does the unemployment numbers today increase the urgency of doing a phase four secretary mnuchin  well let me just say you know we’re going through something that we’ve never done before where the government has shut down big parts of the economy because of health reasons  our economy was in great shape our companies were in great shape there are three ways that americans are going to be protected for small business they’ll get paid by their business through this program  the direct deposit  there’s also enhanced unemployment so we realized unfortunately there are a lot of companies that because they aren’t in business over a short period of time — again we’re working with the states on enhanced unemployment and as soon as the medical professionals and the president give the all clear we’re going to have a ton of liquidity  we have about  trillion — this has never been done between us and the fed — to put into the economy to support american workers and american business    mr secretary in addition to the jobless numbers we saw today phase three was signed before the social distancing guidelines were extended for another month  so what additional relief are you going to give to americans as they stay out of work for all these extra weeks  i mean what are you waiting for secretary mnuchin  well we — in designing this program we thought that we had liquidity for about  weeks  and that’s what we’ve designed and again i think the president’s been very clear if we need to go back to congress to support the american economy and american workers we will be doing that     secretary mnuchin house speaker nancy pelosi has formed a select committee to oversee the distribution of recovery funds  and she says she wants to make sure that those funds are wisely and efficiently spent  do you think that select committee is something that’s necessary secretary mnuchin  i don’t  i mean you know the — both parties wanted us to have oversight wanted us to have transparency  we have full transparency  we have a oversight committee that the speaker gets to pick someone the leader gets to pick someone  i believe there’s five people on it  and again that committee will review the money that we’re spending  and again we support full transparency  taxpayers should understand how we’re going to support this economy and jobs    mr secretary senator murkowski has asked you to consider providing loans to energy companies under the cares act the phase three bill  what are your thoughts on that  would you consider providing those loans to energy companies secretary mnuchin  so thank you and let me clarify  i have very limited ability to do direct loans out of the treasury  i can do them for passenger airlines cargo airlines contractors and national security companies  outside of that we work with the federal reserve to create broadbased lending facilities which we will do so so our expectation is the energy companies like all our other companies will be able to participate in broadbased facilities whether it’s the corporate facility or whether it’s the “main street” facility but not direct lending out of the treasury    a question for clarity about the direct payments to americans  for those folks who don’t have bank accounts who don’t have direct deposit information on file with the irs how long would they have to wait for their check secretary mnuchin  well for people who don’t have direct deposit — again we’ll have an easy way they put it up  we can on a rolling basis — i think you know within a couple of days when they give it to us we’ll send the money out  we do realize there are people who are underbanked and again we’re working with all the digital companies prepaid debit cards  we’re working with all of them to make sure we have a process that every american gets their money quickly  this money does people no good if it shows up in four months  and we will deliver on that promise    so “quickly” is a matter of weeks then perhaps not months secretary mnuchin  “quickly” is a matter of weeks and not months  that’s correct    mr secretary would you consider a moratorium — secretary mnuchin  in the back  go ahead    mr secretary one area where you can make direct loans is to the airlines  how much do you expect that the treasury department and the federal government will be involved in overseeing the operations of airlines as it pertains to which routes get cut back how much they operate what they do about their employees and the like secretary mnuchin  so there are — there are very strict requirements that’s built into the bill  again this was a bipartisan requirement  one anything we do with the airlines they have to maintain substantially all of their employees  so again any money that we provide them will go to pay their employees  we’re going to be working with the secretary of transportation  there are requirements to maintain certain routes so again we have a very clear process  we’ve hired three outside advisors who will be financial advisors and three law firms  we’ll be releasing that information shortly  and i want to thank them  they’re all working for basically very very little money  they couldn’t work for free so they’ve agreed to basically work for what they would sign up to work for charitable organizations so again no big fees to bankers  we’ve got a great team of three lawyers and three financial advisors that will assist us    mr secretary just to follow up on that will you give us a list of the names of those people who are advising you when you release the information secretary mnuchin  of course we will  we’ll give you the names as well as the contracts  so again —    do you have any names right now other than blackrock secretary mnuchin  so again i’m happy to announce we have — the pjt partners — okay — is going to do the passenger airlines moelis  company is going to do the cargo and contractors and perella weinberg will handle the national security  and there’ll be three law firms which we’ll announce shortly that will be working in each one of those sectors and again let me just be clear we need to get this done quickly  the airlines need money  we’re going to work very closely with the department of transportation and get this done quickly  we’ve actually already received contracts from a lot of the people  again there’s guidance up on the web  full transparency  we’ve asked for applications    mr secretary on the airline issue again you know speaker pelosi and others have said that the government taking stakes in those airlines should not be a condition for the federal government to provide payroll support specifically  what’s your response to that secretary mnuchin  i spoke to the speaker last night about that  this was something that was highly negotiated between the republicans and the democrats  the president was personally involved in this  he was on the phone with us many times  mitch mcconnell mark meadows senators on both sides there is a specific line in the bill that says that the secretary meaning me will determine proper compensation  so this is not a bailout for the airlines  and i will be working — once we get our advice from our financial advisors we get the applications from the airlines i’ll be working very closely with the president and we’ll make sure that we strike the right balance not a bailout  taxpayers get compensated  but these airlines — these are national security issues  we want to keep our airlines intact    mr secretary just more broadly for — perhaps for the administrator if not for you as well  some small businesses restaurant owners for example are finding that laying off their employees so that they can start collecting unemployment is better both for them as business owners and for their workers  what incentives do they have right now to keep their employees on the payroll if no one is coming into their restaurant secretary mnuchin  well the incentive that you have — and we want american business to be kept intact  the incentive is these are loans that turn into grants  so if you’re a business owner and you’re a restaurant you can hire your people back you get money for their medical  you keep them on the medical plan  you get money for your rent  you get money for your electricity  so you’re motivated  we want you to have a business that you can reopen quickly when it’s appropriate  so this doesn’t cost the business owners anything you know when people talk about — i can’t imagine any american worker who had a job has offered to keep their job isn’t going to want to have it  and let me just be clear — we’ve also talked about this unemployment issue  you can only get unemployment if you don’t have a job  so unemployment is intended for those people that are some of the midsize or larger businesses — and we’re very sympathetic to this — that these companies can’t afford  and for those people the enhanced unemployment will be a significant benefit but we want to make sure —  percent of the american workforce is small businesses under  people  the president the vice president the administrator and i want to make sure this part of the economy is ready and intact when we’re ready to reopen    a question for the administrator if i may  is there a certain category of small businesses that you’re most concerned about  restaurants hair salons things like that administrator carranza  that’s a great question  we’re concerned about every small business  there’s  million small businesses that we’re really focused on  and we’re working feverishly to make sure that we can provide the available funds to them as quickly as possible so it’s  million small businesses and the other businesses are being dealt with with the ppp with the paycheck protection  there was also the disaster — what we call it the injury — or economic injury disaster loan  and then there was an advance associated with that particular program as well so to answer your question we’re concerned about all businesses  and as the secretary indicated we’re looking at employees being ready not lost in this process  we want businesses to stay intact because they represent half the — half the gdp  so if we spend a trillion to support  trillion or  trillion i think that’s a significant investment and that’s what we’re focused on    is there a certain segment that’s particularly vulnerable secretary mnuchin  let me — i just want to — hang on  i just want to make one comment for explanation because i want to make sure everybody out there understands this  if you’re an independent contractor if you’re a sole proprietor you’re eligible for this as well  now that program won’t be up and running until next week but again this is a very broad definition of small business  so if you’re an independent plumber if you’re an independent contractor you’re covered under this program  it’s slightly more complicated you have to come in to your bank and give them more information  but starting next week that part of the program will be up and running also charities  charities as well  very important  the vice president and president made sure that we covered small charities in this    and does that include churches and religious nonprofits secretary mnuchin  it does although there are some technical issues  but yes it does include faith organizations    is that under the under the — that’s under the sba program secretary mnuchin this is under the ppp  yes the new sba program they are covered the president  okay  thank you all very much secretary mnuchin  okay  thank you everybody the president  thank you jovita  thank you steve  great job  thank you okay so that begins right away and they start handing out checks  and a lot of people are going to have their businesses built back up quickly i hope  and we’ll see  it’s complicated big  small business is actually big business  so i thank them both and please — good  we have some great gentlemen  let me see  great gentlemen  that’s correct  thank you very much today my administration is also issuing new guidelines to protect elderly americans who remain the most vulnerable  by now nursing homes should have suspended the entry of all medically unnecessary personnel today we’re further recommending that all nursing home facilities assign the same staff to care for the same group of residents consistently to minimize any potential spread  and we’re also urging facilities to designate separate areas for healthy and sick residents  and this is a practice that we probably will be recommending into the future long after the enemy is gone — this particular enemy is gone we’re also making every effort to provide relief to our great veterans  we take very good care of our veterans  at my direction secretary wilkie will use any authority at his disposal to extend deadlines for benefits and to postpone debt collections we’re now conducting well over  coronavirus tests per day  it’s over a thou — a hundred thousand test a day –and these are accurate tests and they’re moving rapidly — which is more than any other country in the world both in terms of the raw number and also on a per capita basis  the most the fda has also authorized the first coronavirus antibody test developed by cellex a key step that will help identify people who have recovered and to understand their immune response and their immune system moments ago i directed secretary azar and acting secretary wolf to use any and all available authority under the defense production act to ensure that domestic manufacturers have the supplies they need to produce ventilators for patients with severe cases of covid   you know what that is right  become a very famous term covid — covid this action will help general electric hillrom medtronic resmed royal philips and vyaire medical overcome obstacles in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilators  we have over  being built right now or soon to be started  we anticipate issuing more orders under the defense production act in the very near future in addition to the one that i’ve just signed against  for facemasks — we just signed an element of the act against   and hopefully they’ll be able to do what they are supposed to do  i just spoke to mary barra of general motors and she said they’re very soon going to be ready to start production of the ventilators  they have a lot of ventilators that they’ve committed to build and they’ll be starting very very quickly fema continues to deliver resources to areas most affected by the virus including new york  on top of the  beds we’re already providing to the javits center the department of defense is adding another  icu beds governor cuomo has asked that this facility go — and it’s a big beautiful facility — it be converted to a covid hospital  and we hadn’t done that yet  we hadn’t thought in terms of doing that  but their use is — their real demand is for that  and we had meetings on it with the task force  we had meetings with the military  and i’ve decided to say “yes i’m going to do that” that i will be signing and agreeing to a “yes” answer so that — we will be doing that and also we will be staffing it  so the federal government is doing a lot of things that wasn’t anticipated that it do this is a  — andor  can easily be set up — hospital built in javits center  and so we’re going to be converting that to a  hospital  and it’s going to be staffed by the military and by the federal government and based on the fact that i agreed to that we had two other facilities that were likewise asking for it and that would be in louisiana and also in dallas  and we’ll be doing those  we spoke to the governor of louisiana spoke to the governor of texas  and we’ve told them that we will be staffing those hospitals again above and beyond but that’s okay  we have to do that in addition the usns comfort is docked in new york to accept patients  that is a noncovid to date fema has delivered more than  million  mask respirators  and it’s — think of that  million  four million don’t forget we’re a secondary source  the states are doing it and we’re backing them up  but we’ve gotten  million  respirators  million surgical masks  face shields  million gloves and  ventilators just to the city and to the state of new york  and some of them now are being sent  i spoke with both governor cuomo and mayor de blasio a little while ago and some of them are being sent to the city all of america stands with the people of new york in this time of need  it’s definitely a hotspot but we have other hotspots also  and we’re taking them — taking care of them very very strongly very powerfully  we have the finest people in the world in those locations  and i think the federal government has not only acted early but acted quickly professionally  there’s no people like this doctors nurses first responders and other healthcare providers who want to help new york at this critical time should visit website nycgovhelpnow  nycgovhelpnow  they need help now  they need people to help them we have great facilities and we’ve built some brandnew facilities big ones but we need help  we need help for professional people  so if you’re in an area that isn’t so affected and you’re a doctor a nurse a healthcare worker please get to that website  and we would really appreciate your help  new york city needs it  louisiana by the way needs it  michigan needs it  whatever you can do  those are very strong hotspots they need help in recent weeks as the virus has spread and economic hardship has followed we have seen americans unite with incredible selflessness and compassion  i want to remind everyone here in our nation’s capital especially in congress that this is not the time for politics endless partisan investigations here we go again  have already done extraordinary damage to our country in recent years  you see what happens  it’s witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt  and in the end the people doing the witch hunt have been losing and they’ve been losing by a lot  and it’s not any time for witch hunts  it’s time to get this enemy defeated conducting these partisan investigations in the middle of a pandemic is a really big waste of vital resources time attention  and we want to fight for american lives not waste time and build up my poll numbers because that’s all they’re doing because everyone knows it’s ridiculous so we want to focus on the people of this country even the people of the world — we’re going to be able to help them — because right now as an example we’re building so many ventilators — very very hard to build — but we’re building thousands  thousands of them  and a lot of them will be coming at a time when we won’t need them as badly because it takes time  very complex very expensive  and we’ll be able to help outside of our country  we think we’ll be able to help  that’s something that you cannot easily produce as citizens we’re linked together by the shared bonds of national love loyalty and affection  there’s no earthly force more powerful than the patriotic pride that stirs in our hearts  and that is so true  it’s incredible the job that everybody has been doing  everybody  they don’t sleep  they don’t go to bed  sometimes they get nothing i said to somebody recently on the task force “how many hours’ sleep have you gotten over the last couple of days  the answer was “none  none in one massachusetts neighborhood citizens come out of their homes each night at  o’clock from their porches and they sing “god bless america  others have joined in spreading from house to house down one street up to the next until their little town with a spirit of patriotism and reminding all americans that we’re all in this together  we’ll fight together and we will win together  we’re going to win this now what i’d like to do is — i’m going to step out  we have a meeting on this subject  and i’m going to step out just for a few moments  i’ll be right back  we’ll answer some questions but you have some very hardworking people who have done an incredible job led by vice president mike pence head of the task force  and then jared kushner is going to say a few words  and admiral polowczyk peter navarro dr birx and myself  i’ll be right back so i’ll see you in a little while i did take a test it just came out  this is from the white house physician  you may have it  it just came out  i just took it this morning  and i took it  it took me literally a minute to take it  and it took me i guess it was  or  minutes  i went to work  i didn’t wait for it but he said it took  minutes or something to come up with a conclusion  and it said “the president tested negative for   so that’s the second one i think i took it really out of curiosity to see how quickly it worked and fast it worked and it’s a lot easier  i’ve done them both  and the second one is much more pleasant jeff i can tell you that  much more pleasant so i’ll be back in a little while  and mike please take over  thank you  thank you all very much  i’ll be right back the vice president  thank you mr president  the white house coronavirus task force met today but earlier in the day the president convened all the key elements of our supply chain team in the oval office for an update on the progress that we have been making working literally around the clock to make sure that our healthcare workers the people on the frontlines have the personal protective equipment and also the ventilators to be able to meet this moment and today you’re going to hear from the people that are literally working — working each and every day to make that happen  dr deborah birx is also with us  she’ll reflect in a few moments on the progress that we’re making analyzing the data  each and every day we’re looking county by county state by state consulting with governors and local health officials at the present moment more than  million tests have been performed  and as you all are aware some  americans have tested positive for the coronavirus with now the losses over  americans  and our hearts are with their families beyond that we have been focusing not just on ensuring the testing is occurring but that the supplies are flowing  as the president just announced he made a decision today to deploy thousands of  masks directly to new york city’s public hospitals  and our team will speak about that in just a moment and also the president took the unprecedented step to direct the department of defense to use military healthcare personnel to operate all covid facilities at the javits center in new york at the convention center in new orleans and at the convention center in dallas  and we informed each of the governors of those states today that at their request we were making those military medical personnel available to operate in an allcovid facility but we would emphasize to people in that community who believe you’ve been impacted or have contracted the coronavirus contact your local healthcare provider  we anticipate in the new york area that your local healthcare provider will make the decision whether you are transferred to the javits center  and in all cases simply look to the guidance of your local governors about how best to receive the care that every american — every american is entitled to have beyond that let me say that we have been working through fema’s acquisition process not only to deploy but to gather up personal protective equipment and in just a few moments you will hear from admiral john polowczyk about the extraordinary progress that we have made in deploying not just the strategic national stockpile but also in identifying on the commercial marketplace around america and around the world literally millions of  masks surgical gowns gloves protective equipment  and at this point we’ve distributed some  ventilators  and you’ll hear today specifically about the states that have received those ventilators we’re just — this team has truly acted in an inspiring way and literally is working with dozens and dozens of people at the fema stabilization task force to make sure that we are leaving no stone unturned to find the supplies we need let me also say today you’re going to hear from jared kushner senior advisor to the president of the united states but someone that the white house coronavirus task force directed to work with fema on supply chain issues  and in recent weeks he’s been leading a working group in conjunction with fema that literally has identified millions of medical supplies around the nation and around the world  and we’re grateful for his efforts and his leadership finally you’ll hear from peter navarro who will explain the action the president took today using the defense production act but as you hear details today about medical supplies that have been distributed those that have been purchased those that we’re making available the ventilators distributed to hospitals and those that are available let me just remind every american that you can make a difference in ensuring that every patient has the treatment that they deserve  every healthcare provider every doctor and nurse and nurse’s assistant has the protective gear to provide the care that you would want your family to have by putting into practice the president’s “ days to slow the spread” i mean we want you to take to heart the president’s coronavirus guidelines for america first to protect your own health to protect the health of your family to protect the health of your community  we know so many people are asymptomatic and people that literally don’t know they have the coronavirus but have the ability to infect others  we want you to put these guidelines into practice social distancing using a drivethrough at a restaurant washing your hands on a regular basis but as we focus today on supplies make no mistake about it every american can make sure that our healthcare workers and more importantly americans that are struggling with coronavirus have the equipment to support their treatment by putting these principles into practice because the fewer americans that contract the coronavirus the fewer americans will have to enter our healthcare system  and that’ll continue to preserve the capacity in our healthcare economy so we thank the millions of americans who have responded in the first two days of “ days to slow the spread  and i’m just absolutely confident that in the days ahead every american is going to do their part — for your health your family’s health the health of your community — and to ensure the strength and vitality of the greatest healthcare system in the world with that let me introduce jared kushner to speak about the work that he’s been doing working with fema on ensuring a strong supply chain to meet this moment jared mr kushner  thank you mr vice president  and thank you for your great leadership on the task force and thank you to dr birx and dr fauci as well  it’s been an honor working with you these past few weeks when the vice president first asked me to help on the task force with different tasks i asked the president what he expected from the task force and how i can best serve him and the task force what the president asked is that all of the recommendations that we make be based on data  he wanted us to be very rigorous to make sure that we were studying the data collecting data  a lot of things in this country were happening very quickly and we wanted to make sure that we were trying to keep updating our models and making sure that we were making informed decisions and informed recommendations to him based on the data that we were able to collect and put together the president wanted to make sure that we had the people doing the best jobs and making sure that we had the right people focused on all the things that needed to happen to make sure that we can deliver in these unusual times for the american people the president also instructed me to make sure that i break down every barrier needed to make sure that the teams can succeed  this is an effort where the government is doing things that the government doesn’t normally do where we are stretching we’re acting very quickly  and the president wants to make sure that the white house is fully behind the different people running the different lines of effort to make sure that we get everything done in a speed that the president demands the president also wanted us to make sure we think outside the box make sure we’re finding all the best thinkers in the country making sure we’re getting all the best ideas and that we’re doing everything possible to make sure that we can keep americans safe and make sure we bring a quick end to this in the best way possible and balance all the different aspects that need to be thought of while we do this this truly is a historic challenge  we have not seen something like this in a very very long time  but i am very confident that by bringing innovative solutions to these hard problems we will make progress today we were briefing the president earlier  he asked me to come out and talk a little bit about what we’ve doing on the supply chain task force which admiral polowczyk has been leading  and what he’s been very impressed by is the way that we’ve been resourceful to find product all over the world all over the country  and we are finding ways to solve the different problems the president has been very very hands on in this  he’s really instructed us to leave no stone unturned  just this morning — very early this morning — i got a call from the president  he told me he was hearing from friends of his in new york that the new york public hospital system was running low on critical supply  he instructed me this morning  i called dr katz who runs the system asked him which supply was the most supply he was nervous about  he told me it was the  masks  i asked what his daily burn was  and i basically got that number called up admiral polowczyk made sure we had the inventory we went to the president today and earlier today the president called mayor de blasio to inform him that we were going to send a month of supply to the new york public hospital system to make sure that the workers on the frontline can rest assured that they have the  masks that they need to get through the next month we’ll be doing similar things with all the different public hospitals that are in the hotspot zones and making sure that we’re constantly in communications with the local communities one thing i will say just based on data is that we’ve been getting a lot of data from different governors and from different mayors and from different cities  one thing i’ve seen fema do very very well over the last week or so is now we’re getting realtime data from a lot of cities  people who have requests for different products and supplies a lot of them are doing it based on projections which are not the realistic projections  the projections change every day as we see the cases as we see the impacts of the “stop the spread” effort that this task force recommended and the president has been pushing forward so i do think that we’ll see that  hopefully there’ll be impact of that  and the task force has been working very hard through the fema group with admiral polowczyk to make sure that we’re getting the supplies to people before they run out and making sure that we’re doing it in a proper way i’d like to just introduce admiral polowczyk who before coming to this — i guess still is — he’s the vice director for logistics for the joint staff  i got a call from one of the senators saying “well why don’t you put a great military person in charge of the logistics and the supply chain and the defense production act  and i said “well the president already did that  this is the best man that we have in the country for supplies and logistics  he joined the task force  days ago over at fema and he’s built a team — really at the direction of the vice president — that includes people from fema omb the fda hhs the white house and from everywhere else and what they’ve don over the last  days has been really extraordinary  we’ve done things that the government has never done before quicker than they’ve ever done it before  and what we’re seeing now is we found a lot of supplies in the country  we’ve been distributing them where we anticipate there will be needs and also trying to make sure that we’re hitting places where there are needs so i can tell you the people on the — in the task force they’re working day and night  you’ve got a lot of people in the government  we recognize the challenge that america faces right now  we know what a lot of the people on the frontlines are facing the fear that they have that they won’t have the supplies they need  and our goal is to work as hard as we can to make sure that we don’t let them down so i just want to thank everybody  and with that i want to introduce admiral polowczyk who’s doing an amazing job rear admiral polowczyk  thank you mr kushner mr vice president so today i’m going to cover a couple items — a couple of — five things the first thing i’m going to talk about is resources pushed out from the federal government  and then i’m going to talk about this air bridge which you may have heard about  i’m going to talk about data  as you said we’re — mr kushner is absolutely right we’re trying to be data driven  and with that i’m going to talk a little bit about how we’re trying to expand the industrial base here to meet this challenge so the first thing i want to talk about is surgical masks  so we’ve all — we’ve quickly stated numbers here  so these — i’m about to go through several different slides to give you just scale and magnitude of federal resources that have been applied at the problem so  million surgical masks pushed out to state governments  for  masks  million  masks  and so if i was — if i was in a local hospital that was running short i would — i would look upward because the federal government has pushed out resources so for protective gloves  million   million pairs of protective gloves  for face shields  million face shields  for ventilators we have pushed to the states more than  ventilators  and i think as i was coming over here that number has changed slightly  i think it’s now  given to these states — to the predominantly of these states so we wanted you to have some numbers now as we’ve indicated we have ventilators in the national stockpile  we pushed ventilators out  we’re holding ventilators to put to the point of need  but we’re also buying ventilators asking the industrial base who produces approximately — prior to covid approximately  ventilators a year  we are going to over the next several months by the end of june work to acquire  and so one of the — one of the tools that we’re going to — i can anticipate needing — we’ve already executed — is all of those vendors that we’re buying them from will need — potentially will need help in their supply chains with their suppliers  we might rate orders  we might help them get ahead of others in that endeavor  so i think mr navarro is going to talk a little bit more on that later so let me talk about the air bridge  so it normally takes approximately  days to get from overseas the product — load it get it to the united states and distribute it  that’s about  days so to prime the pump so to speak we have lined on an air bridge to get product here faster working with our major suppliers as they have — as they work to fill orders to get more to healthcare workers now  we are working to align transportation to product now one of the things we’re also doing is the team that works for me are scouring the globe and finding pockets of personal protective equipment that might not otherwise be in the us hospital supply chain  that is also going on these flights  six completed and a number scheduled  twentyeight flights scheduled here in the near future we’re — we are working towards — some days we’ll have one flight some days there might be two flights multiple flights over the next coming days  these  or — as far as i can see out to a couple of weeks  then again matching product to flights to create volume in the supply chain here faster than the  days i’m just going to leave that up as i talk about a few other items  so let’s talk about new york city and the public health hospitals  i believe they’re called new york city health and hospitals the president directed — as i speak there are pallets being formed truck being loaded  i gave an address in new york city here an hour or two ago  and one of our distributors is making that happen and that delivery will happen tomorrow on the data front this is almost unprecedented  this is a commercial supply chain with six to seven major distributors of health equipment  we brought them all in and we said we need to make informed decisions and we are going to help make informed allocation decisions so within a matter of days feeding from their business systems — their enterprise resourcelike systems — i brought onboard a tool — a supply chain tower — that the dod was using to manage a supply chain for a very complex weapon system  their data goes into a data lake  we have a tool to be able to use their data and see it  i can tell what product is coming in what their orders are what they’re filling what they’re not filling and see the volume in the supply chain and understand what they’re doing down to the county level  we’re working to get it potentially down to the hospital level so this   respirators we took a look in there in the supply chain and we said we can’t — we have the volume to go do that  i called the distributor and they’re making — they’re making that happen we anticipate as the hotspots around the country — we anticipate these vendors at our direction helping them allocate product to the right place at the right time so if i can talk finally about expanding the industrial base  so the vice president was at walmart the other day who told him “i want to get in this game  how do i do that  so i got the call  we provided them specifications  and now walmart is going to have — use their suppliers to cut fabric make gowns sew product  but that’s not always the case  we have lots of folks that want to help i believe you will see in the coming days the use of the defense production act in creative ways to help people that are not doing this today to do it we have essentially leads — well the number yesterday was  — i believe it probably grew today — that we are working with to find how each one of those might need help to get in the game that’s not in the game to increase the throughput through the healthcare market again the president gave me one task get more to our healthcare workers now  and i took that to heart because i have — not that i don’t need that from the president that direction to move out — but i have family in new york  my sister is a nurse practitioner in a westchester hospital and my niece is a nurse on a long island hospital  and i have other healthcare professionals in the family  so i have skin in this game the president asked me to get more to the healthcare workers  i’m going to get more to healthcare workers i’d like to hand it over to mr navarro the vice president  inaudible the  going out tomorrow — rear admiral polowczyk  the  is going out as we speak the vice president  you might want to be very specific about that rear admiral polowczyk  it’ll be — it’ll be delivered tomorrow    can i ask a question the vice president  let me — let me be clear on that if i can  what jared announced what the admiral just unpacked is that pallets are being loaded right now to send   masks — rear admiral polowczyk   respirators the vice president  — to new york city to the public health hospitals rear admiral polowcyzk  to the public health warehouse in new york city the vice president  to all the healthcare workers help is on the way    based on the tools and the data you have available to you where is the logjam  where has it been  how have you identified that rear admiral polowcyzk  i think —    because as you say all this — when we have millions more ppes going out the door as you well know the frontline medical workers are not getting it rear admiral polowcyzk  so i would answer you — i would answer you this way we put up a lot of numbers  i said that if you’re not a — you’re in a hospital and you’re not seeing ppe i would look up to the state level first    but we aren’t —    we’ve hearing from governors sir saying they can’t get the medical equipment that they need    and the reason for that is because according to governors and also by the fact that we haven’t seen any numbers up there about what is going to the private sector can you tell us what percentage of the supplies on these large cargo planes are going to private companies versus fema versus the states  is it  percent rear admiral polowcyzk  so fema is — so this product that we’re moving is primarily commercial product that would enter the commercial system and be distributed through financial business transactions between hospitals and these distributors    so just to clarify that that explains why states say they’re bidding like they’re on ebay because the supplies are going to the private sector and then they have to go there to get the supplies rear admiral polowcyzk  that’s normally how things –that’s normally how things work right  so i’m not here to disrupt a supply chain and say — look these six distributors — six seven — they have six to seven hundred warehouses  they have trucks to go to the hospital door every day  we’re bringing product in  they’re filling orders for hospitals nursing homes like normal  i’m putting volume into that system i would say that we have the data now at last — so we put together this data element over the last you know what  thirteen days  get the people in look at the problem build this  i am now seeing truth about what’s in the supply chain  and i would say that there’s been some abnormal behavior okay    yes  thank you admiral  house oversight committee democrats say that fema officials told them that the ventilators that the government has ordered won’t be ready until june which is well after the expected peak  will the defense production act memo signed today do anything to speed that up rear admiral polowczyk  yes it will  mr navarro will talk about that  we’re on line to receive several thousand ventilators in the month of april and several thousand more ventilators in the month of may ramping up to a big number in june again going from you know an industry that produces about  annum —  annum to a — to a very big number    admiral are you confident that this system means the states with the greatest need are getting the supplies rear admiral polowczyk  yeah so —    because a lot of governors are saying that they can’t get what they need and different states have more pressing urgency obviously depending on the caseload rear admiral polowczyk  so we marry up — we’re marrying up where cdc — where the demand for covid is to what’s in the commercial system  we’re providing that to these — to the commercial system  and we are making allocations to those of most pressing need thirteen days — we now have the data  we now can make informed decisions  and so all of the “i need i need i need” i now know the volume that has been happening and needs to be happening    so admiral with that — and mr president i’d love for you to weigh on — the president  sure    — weigh in on this as well  you talk about — well you alluded to the fact there is possibly some shady business going on that the product is here in the united states and — rear admiral polowczyk  and coming here    yes and it is coming here  it’s coming from china  it’s in warehouses  it’s being made here in the united states  it’s in warehouses  but it’s going to the highest bidder  so what can be done to keep those products here in the united states not go overseas where companies are making a lot of money and — rear admiral polowczyk  yeah  i’m going to let mr navarro talk about that    — and get it distributed to the most critical places here in the us the president  yeah  sure  peter go ahead    i would love to hear — how is that being done  because doctors — i’ve talked to surgeons — mr navrrro  that’s great  great — great question    — on a regular basis mr navrrro  let me — let me give you the — the bigger view of the dpa and we’ll directly address that what we have essentially is a nation at war  we have a wartime president standing behind me  the defense production act is one of the most powerful weapons this administration can use to fight the invisible enemy of the virus when i spoke with you last week i explained the three points of the compass dpa can be used to hit  the first one is mobilization of the industrial base  this can involve things like repurposing from say a distiller like pernod ricard — from liquor to hand sanitizer  it can also involve expansion of production which is having honeywell — which makes  masks — opened a new factory in smithfield rhode island with respect to the second point in the compass — allocation of resources — we have two issues there  if you look at the manufacturer itself what you want to make sure is that the supply chain which can go seventiers deep has enough components in that supply chain so we can actually make what we need  and then once it’s made you also want to make sure that it goes to the right — right people and then the third point of the compass which — which addresses what you’re talking about is basically — “bust ‘em” i call it — hoarding of critical or threatened material so let me walk through what — what the president did today in terms of a strong action and what we’ve done with the dpa across those three points the first order that president trump signed was vigorous swift  it was the gm order which directed gm to make ventilators in kokomo indiana in trump time — which is to say “as fast as possible” as the president mentioned he’d spoke to mary barra today the ceo of gm  that is moving forward at the same time as the ford project is moving forward in rawsonville michigan and i’ve issued a challenge to those two companies à la “ford v ferrari” — this is ford versus gm  let’s see who gets those ventilators out first now the second point of the compass which these two orders address today is this allocation of resource issues  the ventilator companies themselves expressed concern that in this rush to build ventilators there would be pressure on that supply chain  so what they requested that we do and the president do is to use the dpa to give this gentleman here — who’s one of the strongest gentlemen in the world in terms of applying things — is to give him the ability to prioritize that supply chain for those ventilator manufacturers  and he will do things like give them what’s called a “do rating” in the defense procurement which will allow them to get what they need now the second order which the president signed today has to do with the other part of the equation which is once they make the stuff okay does it go to the right folks  and this is a  order  and to be frank over the last several days we’ve had some issues making sure that all of the production that  does around the world — enough of it is coming back here to the right places so what’s going to happen with the signing of that order in trump time is we’re going to resolve that issue with  probably by tomorrow at close of business because we can’t afford to lose days or hours or even minutes in this crisis now the third part of the compass — this third point there — this gets to the hoarding issue  the president stood up here with — he’s the commanderinchief but we have a sheriff in town too attorney general barr  and he stood up here with attorney general barr and bill barr said “i’m going to go out and bust them  and guess what  three days ago doj went into a warehouse in jersey grabbed ppe  and the beauty of that — the beauty of that it wasn’t only seized but within hours it was turned around and given to healthcare professionals in new york and new jersey  that’s a beautiful thing  that’s a beautiful case of using the dpa now what’s going to happen tomorrow is the president is going to sign another order which is in the works  this is interesting there is a black market springing up which you have described where we’re having people bid against each other  brokers come in they’re bidding and bidding on all this different ppe  it’s driving the price up  and guess what  you know where it’s going  the domestic sources here are being exported when president trump heard about that he said “that’s not going to happen anymore under my watch  so tomorrow we’re bringing that order  and what it’s going to do is it’s going to empower customs and border protection with the help of people like the post office and express mail consigners like ups to basically deal with that issue so we are going to crack down unmercifully  and i would say to the hoarders out there and the brokers that are trying to make money off of the misery of people in this country around the world that’s got to stop  and if you’ve got inventory what you need to do is pick up a phone and not call somebody out in — around the world  you call fema and say “we got some stuff  we’ll give it to you at a fair price and be done with that because that stuff has absolutely got to stop    inaudible mr navarro  so that’s — that’s — hang on  hang on  so that’s — that’s what we’re going to be looking for  and when we hear cases like this we’re going to aggressively issue order after order to crack down on it now before — this is not my role to take a bunch of questions but let me tell you one other thing before i leave the podium  it’s a story which i’d love to share with you today because this again illustrates the key principles of this president and this vice president which is to wed the full force of the federal government with the full power of private enterprise and just two days ago we at the white house got an urgent sos from the chief of police of the new york police department  and they are in a situation now because of the strain on their resources where personnel such as their homicide detectives were having to go on into houses and deal with covid issues without protective gear now the beauty of this president is because of his leadership we were able to solve that problem in two phone calls  two phone calls  the first one went to phebe novakovic at the general dynamics  “phebe can you call tom kennedy at raytheon  i need you guys to basically scoop up all the tyvek suits you can and find any gloves you can” this president under his leadership and the voluntary efforts and the pride and patriotism you talked about it earlier that — we had  tyvek suits delivered to the new york pd within  hours  that’s — that’s a new record in trump time at the same time a second phone call was made the tara engel at pernod ricard and laura lane at ups  they were on the same phone call  and i said “tara laura we got this issue they need hand sanitizer  literally within two hours we had  drums  gallons of hand sanitizer on a ups truck heading up to the nypd  and it probably arrived today with a promise from pernod that they will continue to supply the nypd throughout the course of this crisis so this is a beautiful thing that america is rallying to  we are becoming a stronger more united nation  and i couldn’t be more proud of this president this administration these guys up here who are doing a heck of a job organizing the supply chain and my promise to you is that the president is going to use that dpa to make sure that the american people particularly our healthcare professionals get the ppe the medicines everything we need so let me — let me stop there  i don’t think it’s my place here to field a bunch of questions the president  no you’re doing a good job  thank you mr navarro  thank you    mr navarro what’s the status of the “buy american” executive order the president  go ahead  go ahead  answer — mr navarro  sure the president  you go ahead mr navarro  okay — the president  come here  come here  come mr navarro  one of the — one of the things that this crisis has taught us sir is that we are dangerously overdependent on a global supply chain for our medicines like penicillin our medical supplies like masks and our medical equipment like ventilators we have — right now as we speak over  countries have already imposed some forms of export restrictions in their country against the rest of the world  and what we’ve — what we’re learning from that is that no matter how many treaties you have no matter how many alliances no matter how many phone calls when push comes to shove you run the risk as a nation of not having what you need and if there’s any vindication of the president’s “buy american secure borders and a strong manufacturing base” philosophy strategy and belief it is this crisis — because it underscores everything that we see there so the “buy american” order which — which is going through process would do a couple things  it would simply say — not during this crisis because we don’t want to disrupt anything  i want to be really clear about that  but going forward after this is over the va dod hhs and this government buys american for essential medicines our medical countermeasures and the medical supplies and equipment we need at the same time it will deregulate so we can get the fda and epa to facilitate domestic manufacturing  and then innovate  because the key here — the key here is having advanced manufacturing on us soil that can leapfrog other countries so we don’t have to worry about competing against cheap sweatshop labor lax environmental regulations different tax regimes and the massive subsidies of foreign governments who are actually directly attacking our industrial base so be patient with that sir  it’s — the other priorities we have right now are to dpa and what the task force is doing  but if we learn anything from this crisis it should be never again  never again should we have to depend on the rest of the world for our essential medicines and countermeasures the president  and by the way we’ve cut them out also to be honest  we’ve stopped orders going from certain places  and in a couple of places — like we had a big order going to italy on important outfits and some ventilators and it was going to italy  they made the order a long time ago  and i said “you got to let it go  they had an order  and i could have cut it under the act  i could have cut it  i said “nope you can’t do that  you got to let it go  you know they have big problems we had an order going to spain and i said “let it go  i could have stopped it  i said “let it go  we’re going to be fine  i said “let it go  so it works that way also one other thing as to your question oftentimes — and we’ve told this to the governors — mike we’ve been very strong on this — have — if you think there’s bidding between federal government and state let us know and we’ll drop out immediately or you drop out and we lower the price    but states are bidding against each other the president   no no  if we’re bidding against each other i said find out who it is  and usually they know  everyone knows  and we’re notified and we get notified and we’ll either drop out or they’ll drop out  but we have another problem there are  countries out there beyond the states  there are  countries that have this problem  and they’re ordering too  it’s really a mess now in a little while the hardest thing to get are the ventilators because they’re — you know it takes a while to build them  and we have a lot  we have thousands of them being built right now  in a little while they’ll be worth about five dollars  but right now they’re very valuable  and we’re going to have a lot of them being shipped and in fact that’s why general motors called up before — mary  that’s why others called up two days ago  they called up that they’re all in production  and they’ll start — they’re starting to arrive in a week and a half  but there’ll be a time when we’re going to build stockpiles by the way the states should have been building their stockpile  we have almost  in our stockpile  and we’ve been building it and we’ve been supplying it  but the states should be building we’re a backup  we’re not an ordering clerk  we’re a backup  and we’ve done an unbelievable job  like for instance who ever heard of a governor calling up “sir can you build us a hospital of  rooms  and we built it  “can you build us four medical centers  we built it  “can you deliver a ship — a hospital ship — with  rooms  and we did it  and we did it in los angeles too we’ve been an unbelievable — we’ve done an unbelievable job — these people  and so — and thousands of people behind them  but we’re a backup  ideally those hospitals would have had all this equipment  ideally those states should have had all this equipment and i think they will the next time you know you heard the case where thousands of ventilators could have been had at a very inexpensive price three years ago  and a certain state decided not to exercise that right because they wanted to build a road or they wanted to build something else because it’s big money  you’re talking about — i think it was a billion dollars but you’re talking about a lot of money for something that may never happen  because normally on a ventilator — other than a pandemic or an epidemic — you wouldn’t — you wouldn’t need anything like this  hospitals have three ventilators — big hospitals — and they get by with it  and now they want thousands  i mean they want thousands of ventilators  you call up a governor and he’ll say “sir could you send us  ventilators  nobody has ever heard of a thing like this so they’ve done some job  let me just tell you when secretary mnuchin spoke they want you to call not “com” but sbagov — okay — for the application and for information  okay  so it’s sba — small business — sbagov okay  if you don’t mind yeah let’s go  please    thank you sir  thank you mr  president  i want to follow up from a question yesterday regarding i think your administration’s denial of the expansion of obamacare special enrollment period in the wake of this pandemic in your own words — vp pence gave a fiveminute nonanswer — but people facing this pandemic — illness and even worse — most experts say that having healthcare is critical to our nation’s health and financial wellbeing the president  right    can you assure americans tonight that you will reopen obamacare marketplace so that they can be covered in this time of combined health — the president  well we’re — we’re doing better than that    — and financial crisis the president  yeah  no i understand the question  and we’re doing better than that  we’re going to try and get a cash payment to the people  and we’re working out the mechanics of that with legislature so we’re going to try and get them a cash payment because just opening it up doesn’t help as much  so we’re going to work it out  so we’re going to try and get for that certain group of people — it’s a certain group of people — a cash payment go ahead    i really want to ask you about masks but i also just wanted to follow up on a couple of hanging threads there  on just the question earlier about the bidding what happens though when states are bidding against each other on those markets the president  well they have that and they have to work that out  what they should do is they should have — long before this pandemic arrived they should have been on the open market just buying  there was no competition  you could have made a great price the states have to stock up  it’s like one of those things  they waited  they didn’t want to spend the money because they thought this would never happen  and their shelves in some cases were bare  and by the way in some cases they weren’t  they were beautifully serviced  they did a good job  but in some cases their shelves were bare so the best thing they can do is when times become normalized — and they will hopefully soon — and actually you’re going to have a lot of excess material because so much is being done right now in terms of protective gear protective outfits  a lot is being done  it’s going to be — within six months it’s going to be sold for the right price  they got to stack up for the next time but we are doing that  and the admiral has done a fantastic job  senator schumer wrote a letter today and he says “you should put a military man in charge  i said “well chuck if you knew a little bit more we have one of the most highly respected people in the military the admiral  this is what he does too very professionally  and he’s in charge  but chuck didn’t know that okay  jeff please    mr president you tweeted this morning about your call with saudi arabia’s mbs the president  yeah    we’ve had some people say that the figures that you cited — between  million and  million barrels per day — is not what they’re agreeing to  can you be more specific about what exactly they told us the president  i don’t know what they’re agreeing to  i think they might agree to more than that look russia — russia —    did he tell you that sir the president  yeah  he did say that actually  russia talked about  million barrels  russia and saudi arabia are fighting over this  and as everybody knows it’s you know really killing an industry hurting russia badly hurting saudi arabia badly i said “this is an easy one  it should be an easy one  and it may be  and it may be more than that  i was actually told it may be   as i told somebody before it may be  and it may be more than that  maybe it’s   maybe it goes up to   could be as high as  and you know there’s a tremendous oversupply right now  that industry was — it was oversupplied before the virus  and when the virus came along they lost   percent of the world  and there’s an unbelievable — you can’t get a ship now  every ship is loaded to the gills sitting out someplace in the ocean  they’re storage tanks  they’re not even ships they’re storage tanks so it would be great for russia it would be great for saudi arabia  i hope they make that deal but that’s what they told me they said —    inaudible  million be — the president  — they said it’s —    — enough to address the oversupply issues the president  well i think it will be hopefully soon  i think hopefully they’ll announce something soon  now can a deal be broken  can something happen where it doesn’t happen  i guess  in which case there’s another alternative  but i’d rather not see that other alternative  i hope they can make a deal    what do you mean when you say the “alternative” the president  they both want — i think they both want to make a deal  and they’re both smart  they love their countries  they want to make a deal  it’s good but it’s also good for the world if they do because you save an industry    mr president — the president  yeah please  go ahead  go ahead in the back please    what do you by “cash payments” the president  i’m going to let mike because we went over this very specifically  and i’ll let you talk about it mike because you responded last time the vice president   right  thank you mr president  as i said yesterday the president has put a priority on ensuring that no american has to worry about the cost of coronavirus testing  and we’ve been working every day to make sure that americans don’t have to worry about the cost of treatment and at this point the white house coronavirus task force is working on a proposal for the president to use some of the  billion that we’re making available to hospitals to compensate the hospitals directly for any coronavirus treatment that they provide to uninsured americans  we’re working out the details of that  the president will make a final decision  tomorrow we expect an announcement but the president has made it very clear we don’t want american to worry about the cost of getting a test or the cost of getting treatment  and we’ve expanded coverage through medicaid  we’ve expanded coverage through medicare  health insurance companies around the country including blue cross just today announced that all of their members will be waiving all copayments on coronavirus treatment  but for those some  million uninsured americans the president has directed the coronavirus task force to find a way to make sure that they know we will find a way to pay for your coronavirus treatment  and the president will be addressing that and announcing that tomorrow    mr president — the president  go ahead    — a point of clarification and then a followup question  yesterday you said that you spoke to florida governor ron desantis before he issued his stayathome order  did you advise him to issue that order the president  no but i talked to him about it  and he wants to do what’s right for the people of florida  he’s been a great governor  you could see that just by his popularity which is extraordinary  we’re proud of him  he’s done a fantastic job and he made the decision but we spoke before he made the decision yes    and he had also said that he is considering putting people who are suspected of having coronavirus or who have tested for positive for it in isolation centers and that he would potentially use — the president  that i haven’t heard  no that i haven’t heard    so he hasn’t consulted with you the president  i haven’t heard that yes please    thank you mr president  ebony bowden from the new york post  a few hours ago mayor de blasio the mayor of new york said that new yorkers leaving their homes should wear masks  they should also wear masks when they’re with other people  are you considering that kind of recommendation on a federal level  and if you are how would you prevent a rush on  masks the president  well i think they’re going to be coming out with regulations on that  and if people want to abide by them frankly i don’t think you — i don’t think there’ll be mandatory because some people don’t want to do that  but if people wanted — as an example on the masks if people wanted to wear them they can  if people wanted to use scarves which they have — many people have them — they can  in many cases the scarf is better it’s thicker  i mean you can — if you — depending on the material it’s thicker  but they can do that if they want now a recommendation is coming out  we’ll see what that recommendation is but —    is that a cdc recommendation sir the president  but i will say this they can pretty much decide for themselves right now    would that be nationwide  and can i also just ask– the president  nationwide    nationwide — the president  yeah    — not just for hotspots and then i think this is best for dr birx but we’ve heard some differing guidance here  the who and even the surgeon general have talked about various studies that show that masks in addition to maybe not even being helpful to protecting people may actually increase the rates of illness because people touch the masks then they touch themselves the president  sure    can you talk a little bit about just the evolution of — the president  all right maybe i will ask —    — your thinking on this the president  — dr birx  and you might mention that other point also yeah thanks dr birx  no no thank you  so i hope you got from the conference today that we’re triangulating data that we know from the case numbers the testing numbers the supplychain numbers to create an integrated picture so that we can really support hospitals in their needs  and i think that level of granularity is really critical secondly i just want to make the point that we really applaud the governors that are looking at a wholeofstate or a wholeofmetro approach  and what do i mean by that  the united states going into this had about  ventilators across the united states and another  to  anesthesia machines  that’s about five times what most of the european countries have but it’s a matter of distribution to need  and i really applaud the governors that are bringing together their public hospitals with their more private hospitals and their visibility across their state  because what we tried to talk about yesterday is every state every county is different  and that’s why we’re looking at it at that level of granularity and as we move through this epidemic the needs need to be very tailored to those counties and frankly those hospitals  i mean there’s a reason why the president and mr kushner have been very much involved in finding out what the public hospitals need  why is that  because the public hospital sometimes have the weakest supply chain because they’re often sometimes not as attractive to private sector distributors or they may be too busy caring for the needs of patients to be really on top of their order forms and their supply chains so really listening to the community that’s at the front of this fight and getting feedback from those specific communities no matter where they are and listening to the frontline healthcare workers because it’s their reality that is important to all of us whether you’re the mayor or the governor or the federal government and if they’re saying they need something we have to work together to supply that and so that’s what you’re seeing with this triangulation  every county will move through this differently and that allows us to move around these vital issues that protect the frontline healthcare workers and protect the patients through the ventilators to make sure that the supply chain is aligned with the need as it happens now you have to have very good data in order to be willing to work in that level of granularity  and that’s what we’ve been working on to really develop that level of granularity to ensure that so i just wanted to say one other thing about testing just to give you the bottomline data of what we’re seeing  we appreciate the groups who are reporting not everyone is reporting yet  and this is part of us trying to understand at a very granular level we do have two states that do have  percent positives and that’s new york and new jersey  so that confirms very clearly that that’s a very clear and important hot zone louisiana though has  percent of their tests are positive  michigan connecticut indiana georgia illinois — so that should tell you where the next hotspots are coming — are at  percent test positive  and then colorado dc rhode island and massachusetts are at  percent there’s a significant number of states still under  percent everyone that i didn’t discuss  california and washington remain steady at an  percent rate so what we’re seeing finally is testing improving — more testing being done still a high level of negatives — in states without hotspots allowing them to do more of the surveillance and containment and then prioritizing this new rapid test kit to those areas that may not have the same amount of access — to the indian health services and to the public health institutions and the public health and state labs so that they can use that and start forward leaning into surveillance now we know there are people waiting for tests and they’re waiting for tests because when these areas became very — when they got onto the logarithmic curve we prioritized people whose decisions — where the test decision would make it critical for their care  and so we prioritized hospitals and we prioritized nurses and doctors and frontline workers the president good dr birx  so that means if you went through a drivethrough or you went through your doctor you could have that delay so the masks so what i tried to give you is how we’re using data in a very granular way  and so there are — there is experiential data  when you look at communities that have oftentimes utilized masks — in general for personal protection — from when they particularly are themselves sick and have used their mask in public  and we’ve looked at the rate of this  in those populations  and then we’re looking at the scientific evidence to bring those two pieces together let me just say one thing though the most important thing is the social distancing and washing your hands  and we don’t want people to get an artificial sense of protection because they’re behind a mask  because if they’re touching things — remember your eyes are not in the masks so if you’re touching things and then touching your eyes you’re exposing yourself in the same way so we don’t want people to feel like “oh i’m wearing a mask  i’m protected and i’m protecting others  you may be protecting others but don’t get a false sense of security that that mask is protecting you exclusively from getting infected because there are other ways that you can get infected because of the number of asymptomatic and mild cases that are out there and so this worries us and that’s why the debate is continuing about the mask  because we don’t want — when we’re trying to send a signal that every single person in this country needs to stay six feet away from everybody that needs to be washing their hands constantly and know where their hands are — to send a signal that we think a mask is equivalent to those pieces so in the — when the advisory comes out it will be an additive piece if it comes out rather than saying “this is a substitute for…  and we want to make sure everybody understands it is not a substitute for the presidential guidelines that have already gone out and to be absolutely clear about that    dr birx can i ask a follow up about the testing please the president  go ahead    dr birx there’s a lot of evidence we’re seeing — that the experts are saying that a high number of these tests could be producing false — false negatives  so — dr birx  of the roche and abbott tests    that as many as one in three tests might be providing false negatives  and i was wondering — maybe you could explain or — dr birx  that would be almost be impossible with —    — tell a little about the science dr birx  — having  percent positives  you — if that was true you would have  percent positive —    are you concerned about the underlying data — dr birx  — or  percent positive so what i can tell you is the number of positive tests is tracking very closely with the number of cases diagnosed  so i don’t — i will look into that i look at the roche and abbott numbers every night  they’re trending exactly in the same way  and that’s important when you’re validating data to really validate “does this same site” — in other words i’m looking between testing sites to see are there consistencies  is there an anomaly  to make sure for what you just very specifically asked  so i will go back and look at it more carefully  i haven’t seen that kind of anomaly this is — this same platform is being used across the country and that’s a range from what i reported  percent positivity up to  percent positivity  and that range reflects also what we’re seeing with the hotspots and the number of cases  and frankly – i mean we hate to talk about it but it also tracks with the hospitalizations independent of diagnosis and the mortality that we’re seeing  so all of those pieces validate together    there’s no concern that there might – people might be getting a false sense of security or that we might not be seeing all of the data here on – and who has it dr birx  well i’m telling you i’m still missing  percent of the data from reporting  i have  tests reported in we’ve done  million  so there is — and it could be those sites so we do need to see all — the bill said you need to report  we’re still not receiving  percent of the test    dr birx with regard to the test the president’s sample collection took one minute results reported back in  minutes  i realize you’re the president of the united states but when will everyone get to take a test that works that quickly and you get results that quickly dr birx  so these are new tests and we have prioritized the groups that we think have the least access to testing now  and who do we mean by that  we mean the indian health service — they’re often in remote areas rural areas  the governors of the northwestern states that may not have the advantage of these highthroughput machines that are often across the east coast and in high metro areas — colorado — and then across the west coast so we’ve prioritized the presidential  test to the indian health services and public health labs so that they can support nursing home testing and other areas where we think surveillance is absolutely key  so at this moment they’re prioritized in that way the vice president  it’s thirteen to twelve hundred dr birx  yes  of them are going out that way    so do more of those tests need to be made in order for more people — the president  they are being made dr birx  yeah    okay  so in a matter of – the president  they’re moving very quickly — it’s happening — in this case dr birx  so i’m glad you asked that because today there’s  of these machines already out there  we’re trying to find out exactly where everyone is because you can see that gives you amazing flexibility  because if people would allow it to be loaned to a state that’s in a hotspot or a state where you want to do additional surveillance  tests  machines is a huge amount  and it really gets to your very question about how we can prioritize what we have at the same time we’re moving out what is new and so really figuring out who should those go to how — who can we ask communities — because these will be in the community — to share those machines into the community who need the testing now  and i think that’s really an incredible question that really needs to be answered over the next  hours    dr birx a point of clarity about the facecovering guidance  you said it’s still a point of debate  you said — you used the phrase “the guidance if it comes out  is the guidance coming out and when the vice president  yes  yes    and — and when sir the vice president  in the — in the days ahead  we’re currently working through the task force taking the consultation advice of cdc our top health experts and we’ll be bringing forward the guidance from the cdc in the next several days dr birx  just remember it’s not a substitute for everything that we’re asking people to do  and just to — to everybody out there across the country when we say no gatherings of  we’re looking at — we want it to be clear  if you have a family of  we don’t want you to be split up  but we don’t expect people to be having dinner parties cocktail parties i mean i know you’ve seen the slope in the united states versus the slope in italy  and we have to change that slope  we have to change the logarithmic curve that we’re on  we see country after country having done that  what it means in the united states is not everyone is doing it so we’re only as strong as every community every county every state every american following the guidelines to a t  and i can tell by the curve and as it is today that not every american is following it  and so this is really a call to action  we see spain we see italy we see france we see germany when we see others beginning to bend their curves  we can bend ours but it means everybody has to take that same responsibility as americans    mr president    dr birx does that mean —    mr president can i have a quick followup on oil please  in your conversations with russia and saudi arabia did you have to make any concessions to get them to agree to cut their production the president  no    like did you agree to cut us production of oil the president  no no  we didn’t discuss that  they want to do that that’s good for their countries and we did not discuss that now    mr president nbc news has learned that the navy is set to fire the captain of the uss theodore roosevelt after he raised red flags about the  outbreak on his ship  it appears as if he’s being punished for trying to save the lives of the sailors in his command  what’s your assessment the president  oh i don’t think so at all  but we’re going to wait a little while because i understand there’s a news conference by the secretary of defense about that  but you know i don’t — i don’t agree with that at all  not at all  not even a little bit yeah    mr president thank you  this morning you said once again that new york got off to a late start and they should have pushed harder  but governors and other state leaders say they rely on the federal government to assess the situation and how risky it is  and they want to know how would they have known to start sooner without your guidance the president  well they have experts  and frankly long after we came out and talked about it — look how would i have known to cut off china  i cut off china very early  and if i didn’t we would have a chart that you wouldn’t believe  so how would i know to do that  how would i know to cut off europe  i cut off europe very early  i mean you have to make a decision  people knew that some bad things were going on and they got off to a late start  and some others got off to a late start also  but we cut off china  if we didn’t cut off china we would have been in some big trouble  and we cut it off    but do — the president  and you know what  we cut it off way early go ahead    mr president to follow up on the insurance point and a separate question that came in from a colleague who can’t be in the room — the president  too bad    on the insurance point is there going to — the president  who are you with  who are you with    roll call  is there going to be an opportunity for insurance companies — if in fact hospitals are compensated for uncompensated care – the president  right  right    — are the insurance companies going to also get compensated for extraordinary expenses that they may have  or are they assuming that cost the president  so we haven’t discussed it but we’re talking to them  you know getting them not to pay copays in the case of the big ones was a tremendous thing  that’s a lot of money they gave up  but we’re discussing that with the insurance companies    okay the president  we’ll let you know  it’ll be pretty quickly yeah go ahead    on — i have a question on japan sir  they are expanding their entry ban to include the united states  are you planning to take any similar action to ban japanese nationals from coming to the us as a result of this crisis the president  well we’re looking at a lot of things and a lot of different bans  we have more bans than anybody  we had bans when bans weren’t fashionable if you remember right at the beginning of this administration it was for different reasons  but we’ve had bans long before people thought of bans when i did china it had never been done before  i was the first one to do it  remember that  it had never — according to what i read in all the papers this had never been done  this is a terrible thing to do  and four weeks later they were all saying “we’re lucky we did it  so we’re looking at it  no we heard that  and i think it’s fine that they do that  they’re trying to protect their country and we have to protect our country yeah please    mr president –    mr president i asked you yesterday about stayathome orders – the president  yeah    — and if that you know decision should be left in the hands of governors or if you’re considering telling the entire nation “stay at home” the president  yeah    so just today the — georgia’s governor finally issued a stayathome order – the president  yeah    — saying that individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt bad but we didn’t know that until the last  hours  is that ignorance gross incompetence the president  he’s a good governor brian kemp  he’s a very good –    you’ve been having calls with these governors the president   he’s a good governor and he has to make his own decision on that  i let the states — i think we’re about  percent positive on that if you look i think it’s about  percent of the states have got the stayathome  brian is a great governor  we’ll — it’s his decision  he made that decision  ultimately he decided to go along with it    do you think it was smart decision to wait the president  and they’re doing — and they’re doing well  and the state is doing well in many respects yeah go ahead please    this is another question from a colleague who couldn’t make it in today  from emily goodin at the daily mail  i had a question in regards to the russian plane that landed at jfk with medical supplies  did the united states ask russia for this aid or is it just accepting it the president  we’re accepting it  it was a very nice offer from president putin  i spoke to him the other night as i told you  and they had excess medical equipment things  and i’ll take it  i’ll take it    he just offered you — the president  i think it’s very nice  we’ve had some from china  we also help other countries  we like doing that  like i said before if we have excess stuff we let it go out  we let some go out where frankly they had orders for it and i didn’t want to stop orders  it was a very nice gesture on behalf of president putin  and i could’ve said “no thank you” or i could have said “thank you  and it was a large plane of very highquality medical supplies  and i said “i’ll take it”    is he offering any further aid in your conversation the president  i think he would if we asked for it  but he was very nice  it was part of the call  he suggested — he said “we have it  it’s additional  they have very big difficulties with this virus also as you know — russia  i thought it was a very nice gesture on behalf of president putin  i could have said “no i don’t want it” or i could have said “i’ll take it  and you know what i said  “i’ll take it”    and would you accept further aid the president  i think so yeah  if they sent things that we need i’d take it  sure  nice gesture    are there concerns about russians using it as propaganda the president  i’m not concerned about russian propaganda not even a little bit  he offered a lot of medical highquality stuff that i accepted  and that may save a lot of lives  i’ll take it every day please in the back    mr  president you said — in january you tweeted that you stand with the people of iran since the beginning of your presidency and you’ll continue to stand with the people of iran given the fact that they’re so hard hit with the coronavirus — the president  oh they’re very hard hit  they’re very hard hit    but would you consider — the president  in a lot of ways they’re hard hit  they’re hit in — with their economy with their military and with obviously the virus  they’re very hard hit    would you consider easing sanctions to allow medical supplies to get in the president  well they haven’t even asked us to do that okay    but we know that sanctions hit the people not the government the president  you know what  they haven’t even asked us to do that    but how does a person — the president  if they want to meet we’d love to meet and we’d love to settle the whole thing out  but i doubt they’ll be —    but how does a — realistically how does a person in tehran pick up the phone and call you  i mean — the president  i think they love america  i think the iranians love america  i think they’d love to be free  i think they’d love to have just some of the things that we have you know i remember iran many years ago — friends of mine were always in iran  they were doing real estate deals in iran  they were building beautiful buildings all over iran  apartment houses  it was — they were very successful  and then one day that came to an end but you know what  the people of iran they remember that  it was a long time ago but not so long ago  and they remember it  and i’ll tell you they love america  they love what we stand for  and we’re not looking for cha — we’re not looking for government takeover government change you know this country has been through that many times  that doesn’t work    so inaudible health of the people would you encourage other countries to — who are maybe concerned about running afoul — the president  well what i did — yeah  what i did as you know —    — of sanctions to — the president  — i put it out very publicly with respect to iran  i said if they need help with respect to the virus we’d love to send — we have the greatest medical professionals in the world  we’d love to send them over    so what countries are you encouraging perhaps to — to lend their support  because there are many countries that feel — the president  i’m not encouraging or discouraging  they’ve been a very hostile country  they made a deal that president obama should have never made  it was a shortterm deal giving them  billion giving them  billion in cash  green  fill up this room five times  look —    but your administration — do you have a moral responsibility to — the president  no  not at all  nobody has even asked me about it  i have a moral responsibility to help them if they ask  if they — if they needed help i would certainly consider different things    well the united nations says they need help the president  well that’s up to the united nations  i’m talking about us  and what happens is if they wanted help — because they have a very big case of virus  a very very big case  it — one of the worst on earth if you believe what you’re reading  and i happen to believe what i see and what i know  and if they wanted help we’d give them help yeah  you had one in the back please    yes mr president and a question for jared too  the — you talk about a granular approach to receiving data from these different states and regions to try and figure out what they need  the president — you just enacted the dpa on ventilators and masks  are there are signals from across the country that might indicate there are other things besides masks and ventilators that are slowly kind of rising in terms of need — like hand sanitizer for instance the president  go ahead mr kushner  sure  so the first — the first issue that we’ve been dealing with was really the ventilators  that was the number one number two and number three from all the states what we’ve been finding is that people have a lot of these requests based on the models  and what we’ve been trying to do over at fema is say to the states “well if you would like ventilators we need to see — first look in your states  right  so for example in northern jersey they’re going down to southern jersey and they’re finding ventilators and trying to relocate them to where they have their hotspots the second thing that we’ve done asked them to survey for alternative ventilators dr birx spoke before about the anesthesia machines and the ability to — to convert them to be ventilators  so we’re asking people to be resourceful inside their states before they come to the federal government the third thing we’ve been asking states to do is to provide what their daily utilization rates are  so everyone is asking for everything  one congressman got a call from his local hospital saying “i need  ventilators  and he said “well you don’t have a covid patient within four counties why do you want  ventilators  and he says “well we just want to be safe  we’re very nervous right now” so what you have all over the country is a lot of people are asking for things that they don’t necessarily need at the moment  and the job of fema and admiral polowczyk has been to try to make sure that we’re getting the real data from the cities from the states so that we can make realtime allocation decisions based on the data and right now what’s happening is a lot of the different cities and states are providing fema that — that information  we’re talking to them daily  they’re updating that information daily  and that’s enabling the federal government to make much more informed decisions on where they position ventilators you also have a situation where in some states fema allocated ventilators to the states  and you have instances where in cities they’re running out but the state still has a stockpile  and the notion of the federal stockpile was it’s supposed to be our stockpile it’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use  so we’re encouraging the states to make sure that they’re assessing the needs they’re getting the data from their local — local situations and then trying to fill it with the supplies that we’ve given them the same thing with the masks  so the  mask is actually an item that wasn’t used as frequently in the medical profession before this  it was used mostly for diseases  so speaking to a lot of the doctors and hospital administrators they would say they used actually a very low percentage of the  masks what the president and the vice president were able to do with congress was to get the waiver so that you could expand the pool because a lot of the masks were used to — for the construction industries  now there’s a much bigger pool of masks in the country  there was a stockpile  they distributed that based on where they anticipated a lot of the need would go  but a lot of that still is stuck with the states and it hasn’t trickled down to the right places within the states so i would just encourage you when you have governors saying that the federal government haven’t — hasn’t given them what they need i would just urge you to ask them “well have you looked within your state to make sure that you haven’t been able to find the resources” unlike other countries a lot of the medical system in america is a private — it’s not a — it’s not a public governmentcontrolled  so you have to get the data from what’s in their state look at it in that way and then make sure that they’re being resourceful in a way to do that  and also ask them what their utilization percentage is because if one governor is asking for more ventilators and if the federal government sends them more than they need the goal here is not to have ventilators sitting in a warehouse where you have another state or you have people who need them so what we’re trying to do is make informed datadriven decisions both on ventilators masks any other supply we can get to make sure it’s going to the people who need them    i wonder if you could weigh in on the reports of which i’m sure you’re aware where unnamed white house officials have described your role as being something of running a shadow task force  how do you describe your role  how do you describe the qualifications you bring to your role mr kushner  yeah  i would just say very simply — look the president asked the vice president to run the task force  the vice president asked me to assist  i’ve been serving really at the direction of vice president and he’s asked me to get involved in different projects the vice president and i speak probably sometimes   times a day  but everything that i’m doing is at the direction of the vice president  if some people are talking to you that means they’re probably not informed as to what’s going on  but i can assure you that i’m speaking with dr birx dr fauci the vice president and the president multiple times a day to make sure that i’m accomplishing and focusing on the objectives that the vice president deems a priority    jared a followup on the ventilators — the president  or they don’t exist    — and the national stockpile the president  or the sources don’t exist  they’re fake persons okay  a lot of fake sources out there  they don’t exist  i read about it — for a long time i’ve been reading  a lot of them — fakes sources  they don’t exist go ahead  please    thank you mr president  jared what triggers sending a ventilator from the national stockpile to a state  in other words how sick does somebody have to be to get one of these national ventilators mr kushner  well that’s not the issue that we’re — that’s not the criteria  you have the states basically putting in the requests and they’re giving us their utilization — their utilization percentages  so it’s a very simple formula  the states should know how many ventilators they have in their states  and by the way some governors you speak to or senators they don’t know what’s in their state  you know some governors i’ll speak to and they’ll know to the number how many ventilators they have in their state because that’s the first thing a good manager will do what a lot of the voters are seeing now is that when you elect somebody to be a mayor or a governor or a president you’re trying to think about who will be a competent manager during the time of crisis  this is a time of crisis and you’re seeing certain people are better managers than others so what i would say is that the way that the federal government is trying to allocate is they’re trying to make sure a you have your data right  don’t ask us for things when you know that — when you don’t know what you have in your own state just because you’re scared you asked your medical professionals and they don’t know  you have to take inventory of what you have in your own state and then you have to be able to show that there’s a real need and so we prepositioned a lot of things because most governors off the bat didn’t know what they needed  but fema has a joint command with admiral polowczyk admiral giroir and pete gaynor where every couple hours when their requests come in they evaluate the request they all vote on the request  and then if there is something that they want to elevate to the taskforce they bring it to the vice president to make a recommendation the vice president  and jared if i may you might ask deborah to — we’re literally tracking hospitalization cases on a daily basis interacting with governors and health systems and that informs our supply chain decisions dr birx  yeah i really — i want to thank the health commissioners and all of them that have been sending hospital data  and i think it’s really critical and important to all of us new york city has been providing information new jersey connecticut rhode island and certainly louisiana in these hotspots  and that allows us — we can see where they are with the rising number of cases where they are in their curve what can be predicted and really ensuring that people get what they need as they need it and so i think many of the governors now and the health commissioners have been “i had to use ” — “i’m intubating  people a day now  i have enough for th next three days  if that doubles…we’re seeing our hospitalization rates stabilizing but we still think there will be this many more in the next days  that’s the information that they then translate into providing the ventilators so when you see the ventilator numbers going out they’re going out in  and   because i think early on we sent a big bolus out and then not all of them even today have been fully utilized and so we want to make sure every state and every hotspot can be reassured that ventilators are there for them as they move through the curve  and i think to date we’ve been able to do that  and i think that’s what’s important to me is that people have what they need when they need it  and to date people who have needed ventilators have been able to get on ventilators  and i think that’s our goal with governors and with the mayor to make sure that that continues to happen but that means all of us have to work together  and i think that’s what’s been really important over the last few weeks is people are not making generic requests anymore  they’re making datadriven requests because they know precisely what’s happening in their hospitals    dr birx when you are up here a little bit ago you talked about the curve and what you’re seeing and you’re concerned that people are not abiding by the social distancing guidelines  i mean you seemed in your voice to be quite concerned about that  has the curve changed enough at this point where that  to  people are likely to die  has that shifted upwards at all dr birx  no  it’s just when i look at what — so we’re in week  in our guidelines  and i guess what i expected when the president put out guidelines that said “don’t go to bars  don’t be in groups more than  people” when we said that now over  days ago that was serious  and then you could see what happened subsequently and you can see the number of individuals have been infected since then  because the people we’re seeing infected today and in hospitals today were infected after the guidelines went out so that’s what we’re worried about and we’re worried about that we’re not — we’re still in this and that’s why the president extended it for  days  but we have to get out of this  we have to start seeing this the president  but deborah aren’t you referring to just a few states  because many of those states are dead flat  i mean so — dr birx  yes the president  so it’s hard to get — it’s hard to be — dr birx  yes  there are states that are dead flat  but you know every — what changes the curve is a new detroit a new chicago a new new orleans a new colorado  those change the curves because it all of a sudden spikes with the number of new cases  because you have a certain projection of new cases and then a whole other city comes on top where they’re in their logarithmic phase so those ones that i talked about that had test results greater than  percent positive all of those — all of those states or all of those counties are in logarithmic phase  that means there are a lot of counties that aren’t and we are really — we’re excited about those counties that have been testing and still finding quite flat  and hopefully maybe sunday or so or sometime this weekend we can go through all the states and the curves again so you can see where you know that california and washington are still steady but we’re watching very carefully because we see that you can go from this to this very quickly  and what — this should not be happening any longer in new places if people are doing the social distancing washing their hands not getting together in large groups more than  the president  again so i look at the graphs all the time dr birx  yes you do the president  and you have many many — dr birx  yes the president  — flatliners  i call them “flatliners  i’m amazed at them  and you have a couple that are up it’s hard to blame the flatliners for not doing a good job dr birx  no no  i don’t want to say that  no  i don’t — no  thank you sir  i don’t want — in fact i want to praise the states that — and i think i want to be able to call them out and show you their graphs so you can see  they’ve had steady small cases  they’re testing and they’re doing a lot of testing  and their percent of testpositives are under  percent  i mean we have a whole group of states who are testing and their positivity rate is under  percent we know what it looks like on the logarithmic curve  you’re in the  percent then  percent then  percent and then  percent  that’s what we’re trying to prevent  and it’s the metro areas that are absolutely crucial in this  and so if you’re in a metro area or you’re in a small city please make sure all of your friends and family are following the guidelines  that’s the best thing we can do the president  no because i saw those pens going five minutes ago  they were so — they were thrilled  and the fact is — yes we compare them to italy  one place but we have many places that are — dr birx  yes the president  — really doing great  and i think that’s what deborah meant  she didn’t mean all of them  so when you write your story tomorrow maybe you’ll write it correctly  she was talking about one state  and another state is you know having a hard time  it’s — and they’re closely associated and by the way the people are doing a very good job including the people that live there  but when deborah was talking about italy she was talking about the one and then the other was lower  and then you have mostly states that have been unbelievable so she wasn’t talking about the average of everything she was talking about an individual state which is i think still better than italy  italy is having a hard time  by the way spain is having a hard time  france is having a hard time but our states generally speaking it’s like lots of different countries all over  we have — many of those countries are doing a phenomenal job  they’re really flat  and i think that’s what you meant dr birx  thank you sir the president  i don’t know i don’t want to — i don’t want to speak for — but i thought — that’s what i understood she meant yeah please    can i ask a question about that though  because coronavirus is present in all  states  you said before that you — when you implored mayors and governors to be serious about this you said “once it shows up mitigation efforts are too late” so how do you then square that with this notion that some states are doing well  i mean the virus doesn’t abide by state law the president  because some states they stay in better  they’re not touching  they’re not — whatever it is  they’re not going out  they’re not in groups  and some states are not probably as good or for whatever reason  or they also live a lot closer  you know new york is very dense and you know california is pretty dense too  and they’ve got a very good record going so far  we hope it doesn’t spike up but it’s very flat  we have states that are doing incredibly well  i mean when i looked at some of them i looked at some states that i would have thought maybe wouldn’t have done as well and they’re really flatlined  hope they stay that way  i hope they stay that way    isn’t that the point mr president the president  say it jeff    sir isn’t that the point that you want those states to stay flatlined the president  i want them — yeah that’s what i’m saying    i mean it seems like you’re — the president  no no no  but when deborah mentioned about italy and our country she wasn’t referring to our country she was referring to one state    but she’s encouraging people to do a better job of following these social distancing measures  that’s what i’m understanding it the president okay  so my understanding — i’m going to let her say it  but i think that everybody would have to be thrilled with the way most states are doing  thrilled    i don’t think she — is that what you meant the president  the flatline — the flatline states — states that have almost no bump  i mean i would think  now then you have others where for whatever reason they’re higher that’s different  but you can’t condemn people living in a flatliner with people living in something where there’s the big bump or the bigger bump or more akin to italy where they have some very unique problems  in all fairness to italy they have some very unique problems but if you’d like to come up and —    so how many flatline do we have the president  a lot of them    and how many do we have — how many  how many do we have dr birx  so why don’t i bring you the whole deck again and we’ll divide out the states so you can see them the vice president  we’ll do it tomorrow dr birx  because you really have to see each state separately  that’s why i started with there are states where you’ve heard me talk about how concerned i was  these are states that before the guidelines went out or right after the guidelines went out — i mean you can look at — it’s on the website if you go to the healthdataorg about when governors made clarity about closing their states as far as the social distancing the washing of the hands the bars the taking — doing takeout  and you can line that up with the presidential guidelines and not all states when the presidential guidelines came out immediately followed the presidential guidelines  not all states did  there are states that also may have gotten many more seeds from outside communities  that certainly is one of the issues that new york and new jersey connecticut and rhode island are facing  the virus came in from multiple places into those states  it was undetected early on and they have a very logarithmic curve what i am saying is even one of those curves in one county in one city is one curve too many  so i am passionate about everyone following the guidelines because of the outlier curves  maybe that was a better way of putting it the president  yeah  that’s exactly — dr birx  the outlier curves — the president  i think that’s perfect dr birx  — in specific counties is to make sure that doesn’t happen anywhere else    so would you feel better if every state did a stayathome order  would you feel better dr birx  well i think most of the states have done that  i think if you — one death from this is one death too many  i mean i come out of epidemics and pandemics  we know what to do  i know we don’t have a vaccine  and i know we don’t have a therapeutic  but we know what can be done and others are doing it and most of the people in the united states are doing it  it’s our communities — it’s every american that has to make these changes and i know they’re really hard and i know it’s hard to remember  i mean i have to say to myself every day because i’m around very important people to like never touch anything  and i’m just like paranoid now about touching things  i’m sure you all are too i mean we’ve gotten to the place where we don’t go to your places on pebble beach we go to the one that’s open aired because i mean you’re trying to protect your reporters  i mean i understand that  we’re all trying to protect each other and we all have to adapt to this new reality that we’re in right now and i believe everybody is trying really hard and i’m just asking them to try really really hard for these next  days because they will make a tremendous difference  we see that evidence  and so it’s like having a vaccine or a therapeutic because we know what works and we’re asking everybody to apply what works  and i know it takes amazing attention to detail because you know the minute you forget or do something you’re like “oh my gosh i should have never done that” and that’s the level of attention it takes    if covering our faces could help us do that and guidelines are coming out — the president  so i just want to say — look many states have started low and slow and then they stayed at a good level  some really stayed at a great level  some — louisiana as an example it was low and slow and they were looking great  i was watching it because you know it’s kind of a place people go to with mardi gras — which sort of is an interesting point because after mardi gras it was low and then all of a sudden it went up very rapidly  and now it’s one of our true hotspots right certain areas of michigan — detroit was — it looked like it was doing pretty good and then all of a sudden it went up  so you have that too but i’ll tell you what we have states that have been really incredible in the fact that they have kept so — so low they have not — you haven’t seen the bump and i hope you don’t  i hope you don’t  and you have a couple that for a lot of different reasons — and that’s not to blame anybody but they are at a higher level  but very few i think deborah — i mean i may say i think most people have actually followed the presidential — you can call them whatever you want  i would never use the word “dictates” because if i used that word i would be in such trouble  in fact you’ll put me in trouble just that i even mentioned the thought of it  okay  but we make a recommendation  and i think they’ve done a good job and maybe they started a little later but maybe they’re also more difficult states but we’ve done i think on average really phenomenally as a country  i think we’ve done phenomenally  because when you looked at that graph the other day — i don’t know if you saw it i assume you saw it  everybody in the world saw it  but you look at all those lines on the bottom — one color after another all different representing different states — it’s all crowded at the bottom  and then you had two that were up  but you had — i don’t know almost every one of them was down low  very low  so there were a lot of people listening and i just did — i want to be clear because i don’t need headlines tomorrow and neither does the country because i don’t want this country working so hard and then have press that is in this case maybe misinterpret something  because i might have — i might have — when i heard it i was surprised at first too but i understood what deborah meant    mr president —    can you clear something else up again the president  but i think it’s very important — because i think it’s very important for you to be accurate one other thing  just a quick thing  so what i found is when governors call me — i mean i think in every case they’ve always been so nice  so nice  and i’ve seen them and heard them say “thank you very much you have done a great job” “a fantastic job” in one case  “thank you  thank you  thank you  then i’ll see the governor usually of the opposite party  in almost all cases except maybe one — but in almost all cases they’re very generous they’re very nice  they thank me  everything is great  we’re doing a great job and then i’ll see them on television and just like a different person  and i realized there are some people because of politics that if they say “we want  ventilators” and i’ll say “no jim i want to give you  ventilators they’ll say “thank you  you are the greatest president that’s ever lived  and then i’ll see them quoted in a paper or see them on a show and they’ll say “the president didn’t come through for me  i’m very disappointed in the president” and we have a lot of that  they’re very happy when they talk to me and then i see them  but there are some people if they asked for  of something and if i gave them  they will say — you’ll say “how’s the president doing  “well we don’t like the job  to my face they’re very nice but then sometimes — i guess they assume i don’t watch them or something but i watch very closely yeah please    mr president one especially vulnerable population is the prison population and that’s — especially with jared here i wondered if you could address what the federal government is doing to protect inmates the president  well it’s vulnerable in that it’s close together really  i — i can’t tell you about age but a lot of young people in prison some people — some states — i have not done that at all but some states are letting people out of prison  some people are getting out that are very serious criminals in some states and i don’t like that  i don’t like it  but it’s a city or state thing in certain cases as you know  i think maybe philadelphia comes to mind  so we’ll see  you have to see what what’s going on  and we don’t like it  the people don’t like it  and we’re looking in to see if i have the right to stop it in some cases okay    mr president  million americans filed for unemployment last week  we haven’t heard you talk a lot today about what they’re going through  so what’s — the president  oh i think it’s —    — your message to them  and — the president  i think they’re going through  i think it’s terrible so look four weeks ago we had the greatest economy in the history of the world  the greatest in the world — greatest in the history of the world  we had the most jobs ever in the history of the united states  almost  million jobs right and then one day i get a call from deborah who’s fantastic and from dr fauci  and he said and she said “we have a problem  i said “what’s the problem  and they said “we may have to close it up  i said “close what up  they said “close up the country  and i said “what’s that all about  and we discussed today — and probably not since  we came to that conclusion — and she is a fantastic person a brilliant person and this is what she knows  i said “has it ever been this bad  and i think i can represent that you said “no  and part of it — it’s a contagion  it’s so contagious it’s like if you sneeze i probably get it  whoever heard of a thing like that  okay  and this very talented reporter is bailing out  okay  he’s out of here  i don’t blame you but it’s a very contagious thing and — probably the likes of which we’ve never seen in terms of that but  — so that’s over  years ago but that was — you know it’s been written about many many times  that was a horrible — whether it was  or  million people — i’ve heard from  to  i’ve heard  to  — but it was tens of millions of people now we have the advantage of communication  this could have been just as bad  i mean here we can read on the internet  we can see what to do  we can have these meetings they can watch on television which they do  a lot of people are watching  a lot of people are watching  and they say “gee social distancing” but in  they didn’t have that option  you know they didn’t know what to do  they just noticed people were dying all over the place  think of it  to  million people died  a lot of people in this country died i always — to me it’s a great — it’s a great question how come more people didn’t die in this country  and they say it actually started in this country and went to europe  i mean we lost a lot of people but relatively we lost very few compared to europe  so this is a terrible thing that happened and what’s happening now with people and jobs — so think of the position i’m in  we have built all together everybody — not me everybody — the greatest economy in history  and all of a sudden people come in that we respect and we know  and here’s the thing they were right  everybody questioned it for a while  not everybody but a good portion questioned it  they said “let’s keep it open  let’s ride it  if we did that — you saw the other graph  and whether it’s true or almost true or maybe not true enough — the number was  million people would have died   million people would have died in a short period of time  in fact the graph could have been even shorter  i always noticed that that horrible one — where it goes high — it actually comes down a little bit faster  it might have been over faster and you would have lost  million people so they come in and they say “we have to close up the country  and i say “you know what that does to this — to the fabric of this country to people that had great jobs great family no problems with money  their  — everything is perfect then all of a sudden they go from that to having no job in one day  they never even thought of it  and then you see  million people unemployed  unemployment numbers get released and you see  million people and it’s an artificial closing  it’s not like we have a massive recession or worse  it’s artificial because we turned it off  think of all we’re doing  we’re saying “don’t go to work and we’ll pay you  everything is the opposite  it was always “go to work and make a lot of money and do well and — the american dream  because of a hidden enemy we’re saying “don’t go to work and we’re going to pay you” look at the money  trillion  and we will probably do more  i think infrastructure would be a fantastic thing to do you want to get the restaurants back  you give deductibility  you understand what that is  you give deductibility for businesses where they go and they use the restaurants  the restaurants will be bigger and better than they were before  you know people don’t know a lot of restaurants closed when they ended deductibility  and then they started doing well but they had fewer restaurants  but the boom of the restaurants is when they had deductibility where corporations could use them  so — and entertainment  that was a great thing but they closed it and then they closed it again  and it wasn’t the same  but if you want to get them back you do that but infrastructure we borrow our money now at zero  you know if were paying  percent  percent  percent it’s a different ballgame  we’re borrowing — we can borrow long term for zero — literally zero you know that — because we’re considered the safe investment  all over the world they want money in the united states  that’s where they want the money so i know better than anybody  i just — i know what they’re going through and it’s horrible  but you know what i want to do  i want to be able to get them back fast  when this is over it’s going to be a day we’re going to celebrate because everyone is going to go to work and i think we’re going to have boom times  i think it’s going to be great and we’ve learned a lot  we’ve learned about borders  we’ve learned about reliance on other countries  we’ve learned so much — so much that i think we really have a chance to be bigger and better and stronger  and i think it’s going to come back very quickly but first we have to defeat this enemy so we will see you tomorrow  thank you very much  thank you end  pm edt</td>\n",

attractive for community bank we ’ ve agreed to raise the interest rate again i encourage everybody take out the paycheck protection program i ’ m also pleased to report the economic impact payment i had previously said this would take u three week i ’ m pleased to report that within two week the first payment will be direct deposit into taxpayer ’ account and a the president said last night the

someone you can immediately get that money you can deduct it from what you owe the irs immediately if you don ’ t owe u money you ’ ll get a refundable tax credit so that is up and running i ’ m also pleased to report we have the program up and running we ’ re taking application from the airline from the cargo company and from national security company so thank you very much mr president the president thank you steve for jovita or steve any question please mr secretary chase bank sent a letter to it business client today saying that they don ’ t have the necessary guidance from the sba from the treasury department to be able to accept loan application starting tomorrow the need is clearly enormous but at least one major bank say they ’ re not fully empowered yet to be able to help their customer secretary mnuchin well a i spoke to all the ceo yesterday — i had a conference call with them — we got very good input from them on what they needed a i said people were working until o ’ clock i believe we just put up the federal register with the new guideline for lender i ’ ve been assured that the bank will be in the process starting tomorrow now again it ’ s going to take a little bit of time but we committed that this will be available tomorrow and i encourage all company go to sbacom sbagov go to treasurygov you can see the information you need immediately just to follow up with the smallbusiness owner a number of them are saying that they were on that conference call and that there ’ s a tremendous power struggle going on between the treasury and sba and that it ’ s over process and form is what they tell me that lender are actually opting out because they can ’ t make enough money to even service the loan so how are you going to make sure these smallbusiness owner get the capital they need to survive right now secretary mnuchin well first of all i can assure you — jovita is here jovita used to work for me a the treasurer there is no power struggle administrator carranza no secretary mnuchin jovita and our team a i said worked together until o ’ clock in the morning and started working at o ’ clock again we ’ ve made the form simpler and i can assure you at five point — i ’ ve told these banker they should take all their trader and put them in the branch there ’ ll never be another opportunity to earn five point on a government — fully governmentguaranteed loan and those check right into direct deposit the irs now saying it would take four to five month you ’ re saying two week can you give u a solid — secretary mnuchin well let me be — let me be clear i don ’ t know where you ’ re hearing these thing i told you this would be three week i ’ m not committing to two week we ’ re delivering on our commitment the irs which i oversee within two week the first money will be in people ’ s account just to follow up on that i think the question is not about the first check for folk who have direct deposit it sound like those will go out pretty quickly the question is then for folk who don ’ t have direct deposit secretary mnuchin sure and there wa a staff memo that wa released by the house way and mean committee today saying that that process could take up to five week sic that take you to midaugust is that how long it ’ s going to take secretary mnuchin that is not going to take five — or five month i ’ m sorry secretary mnuchin again let me just say when obama sent out these check it took month and month and month i am assuring the american public they need the money now what we ’ re going to do is — again if we have your information you ’ ll get it in two — in — within two week social security you ’ ll get it very quickly after that if we don ’ t have your information you ’ ll have a simple web portal you ’ ll upload it if we don ’ t have that we ’ ll send you check in the mail how many check can you process in a week though how many check can you — secretary mnuchin again we can process a lot of check but we don ’ t want to send check in this environment we don ’ t want people to get check we want to put money directly into their account thank you mr secretary this is for i guess both you and the administrator there have been some anecdotal report that business people are trying to get access to the online site to submit the application the website ha been crashing i ’ ve heard of webinars going offline because there ’ s just too many people on them so how are you guy going to be ready you know tomorrow to get these loan out secretary mnuchin we ’ ve brought in a lot of external resource at sba and u to make sure there ’ s additional capacity a i said we heard a lot of good feedback yesterday to simplify this process it ’ s going to be up and running now let me just be clear that doesn ’ t mean everybody is going to get their loan tomorrow but the system will be up and running we encourage people over the next week sign up you can go on right now you can go on the web see what information you need very simple process mr secretary on a separate subject have you been in touch with leader mcconnell and speaker pelosi about their difference right now about another stimulus package secretary mnuchin i spoke to — i ’ ve spoken to the leader i ’ ve spoken to the speaker i ’ ve spoken to the president constantly when the president is ready and think we should do the next stage we ’ re ready the president ha talked about the issue of infrastructure since the campaign i think you know that ’ s a big priority for him and again if we run out of money on the smallbusiness program we ’ ll be back right away to congress to get this increased doe the unemployment number today increase the urgency of doing a phase four secretary mnuchin well let me just say you know we ’ re going through something that we ’ ve never done before where the government ha shut down big part of the economy because of health reason our economy wa in great shape our company were in great shape there are three way that american are going to be protected for small business they ’ ll get paid by their business through this program the direct deposit there ’ s also enhanced unemployment so we realized unfortunately there are a lot of company that because they aren ’ t in business over a short period of time — again we ’ re working with the state on enhanced unemployment and a soon a the medical professional and the president give the all clear we ’ re going to have a ton of liquidity we have about trillion — this ha never been done between u and the fed — to put into the economy to support american worker and american business mr secretary in addition to the jobless number we saw today phase three wa signed before the social distancing guideline were extended for another month so what additional relief are you going to give to american a they stay out of work for all these extra week i mean what are you waiting for secretary mnuchin well we — in designing this program we thought that we had liquidity for about week and that ’ s what we ’ ve designed and again i think the president ’ s been very clear if we need to go back to congress to support the american economy and american worker we will be doing that secretary mnuchin house speaker nancy pelosi ha formed a select committee to oversee the distribution of recovery fund and she say she want to make sure that those fund are wisely and efficiently spent do you think that select committee is something that ’ s necessary secretary mnuchin i don ’ t i mean you know the — both party wanted u to have oversight wanted u to have transparency we have full transparency we have a oversight committee that the speaker get to pick someone the leader get to pick someone i believe there ’ s five people on it and again that committee will review the money that we ’ re spending and again we support full transparency taxpayer should understand how we ’ re going to support this economy and job mr secretary senator murkowski ha asked you to consider providing loan to energy company under the care act the phase three bill what are your thought on that would you consider providing those loan to energy company secretary mnuchin so thank you and let me clarify i have very limited ability to do direct loan out of the treasury i can do them for passenger airline cargo airline contractor and national security company outside of that we work with the federal reserve to create broadbased lending facility which we will do so so our expectation is the energy company like all our other company will be able to participate in broadbased facility whether it ’ s the corporate facility or whether it ’ s the “ main street ” facility but not direct lending out of the treasury a question for clarity about the direct payment to american for those folk who don ’ t have bank account who don ’ t have direct deposit information on file with the irs how long would they have to wait for their check secretary mnuchin well for people who don ’ t have direct deposit — again we ’ ll have an easy way they put it up we can on a rolling basis — i think you know within a couple of day when they give it to u we ’ ll send the money out we do realize there are people who are underbanked and again we ’ re working with all the digital company prepaid debit card we ’ re working with all of them to make sure we have a process that every american get their money quickly this money doe people no good if it show up in four month and we will deliver on that promise so “ quickly ” is a matter of week then perhaps not month secretary mnuchin “ quickly ” is a matter of week and not month that ’ s correct mr secretary would you consider a moratorium — secretary mnuchin in the back go ahead mr secretary one area where you can make direct loan is to the airline how much do you expect that the treasury department and the federal government will be involved in overseeing the operation of airline a it pertains to which route get cut back how much they operate what they do about their employee and the like secretary mnuchin so there are — there are very strict requirement that ’ s built into the bill again this wa a bipartisan requirement one anything we do with the airline they have to maintain substantially all of their employee so again any money that we provide them will go to pay their employee we ’ re going to be working with the secretary of transportation there are requirement to maintain certain route so again we have a very clear process we ’ ve hired three outside advisor who will be financial advisor and three law firm we ’ ll be releasing that information shortly and i want to thank them they ’ re all working for basically very very little money they couldn ’ t work for free so they ’ ve agreed to basically work for what they would sign up to work for charitable organization so again no big fee to banker we ’ ve got a great team of three lawyer and three financial advisor that will assist u mr secretary just to follow up on that will you give u a list of the name of those people who are advising you when you release the information secretary mnuchin of course we will we ’ ll give you the name a well a the contract so again — do you have any name right now other than blackrock secretary mnuchin so again i ’ m happy to announce we have — the pjt partner — okay — is going to do the passenger airline moelis company is going to do the cargo and contractor and perella weinberg will handle the national security and there ’ ll be three law firm which we ’ ll announce shortly that will be working in each one of those sector and again let me just be clear we need to get this done quickly the airline need money we ’ re going to work very closely with the department of transportation and get this done quickly we ’ ve actually already received contract from a lot of the people again there ’ s guidance up on the web full transparency we ’ ve asked for application mr secretary on the airline issue again you know speaker pelosi and others have said that the government taking stake in those airline should not be a condition for the federal government to provide payroll support specifically what ’ s your response to that secretary mnuchin i spoke to the speaker last night about that this wa something that wa highly negotiated between the republican and the democrat the president wa personally involved in this he wa on the phone with u many time mitch mcconnell mark meadow senator on both side there is a specific line in the bill that say that the secretary meaning me will determine proper compensation so this is not a bailout for the airline and i will be working — once we get our advice from our financial advisor we get the application from the airline i ’ ll be working very closely with the president and we ’ ll make sure that we strike the right balance not a bailout taxpayer get compensated but these airline — these are national security issue we want to keep our airline intact mr secretary just more broadly for — perhaps for the administrator if not for you a well some small business restaurant owner for example are finding that laying off their employee so that they can start collecting unemployment is better both for them a business owner and for their worker what incentive do they have right now to keep their employee on the payroll if no one is coming into their restaurant secretary mnuchin well the incentive that you have — and we want american business to be kept intact the incentive is these are loan that turn into grant so if you ’ re a business owner and you ’ re a restaurant you can hire your people back you get money for their medical you keep them on the medical plan you get money for your rent you get money for your electricity so you ’ re motivated we want you to have a business that you can reopen quickly when it ’ s appropriate so this doesn ’ t cost the business owner anything you know when people talk about — i can ’ t imagine any american worker who had a job ha offered to keep their job isn ’ t going to want to have it and let me just be clear — we ’ ve also talked about this unemployment issue you can only get unemployment if you don ’ t have a job so unemployment is intended for those people that are some of the midsize or larger business — and we ’ re very sympathetic to this — that these company can ’ t afford and for those people the enhanced unemployment will be a significant benefit but we want to make sure — percent of the american workforce is small business under people the president the vice president the administrator and i want to make sure this part of the economy is ready and intact when we ’ re ready to reopen a question for the administrator if i may is there a certain category of small business that you ’ re most concerned about restaurant hair salon thing like that administrator carranza that ’ s a great question we ’ re concerned about every small business there ’ s million small business that we ’ re really focused on and we ’ re working feverishly to make sure that we can provide the available fund to them a quickly a possible so it ’ s million small business and the other business are being dealt with with the ppp with the paycheck protection there wa also the disaster — what we call it the injury — or economic injury disaster loan and then there wa an advance associated with that particular program a well so to answer your question we ’ re concerned about all business and a the secretary indicated we ’ re looking at employee being ready not lost in this process we want business to stay intact because they represent half the — half the gdp so if we spend a trillion to support trillion or trillion i think that ’ s a significant investment and that ’ s what we ’ re focused on is there a certain segment that ’ s particularly vulnerable secretary mnuchin let me — i just want to — hang on i just want to make one comment for explanation because i want to make sure everybody out there understands this if you ’ re an independent contractor if you ’ re a sole proprietor you ’ re eligible for this a well now that program won ’ t be up and running until next week but again this is a very broad definition of small business so if you ’ re an independent plumber if you ’ re an independent contractor you ’ re covered under this program it ’ s slightly more complicated you have to come in to your bank and give them more information but starting next week that part of the program will be up and running also charity charity a well very important the vice president and president made sure that we covered small charity in this and doe that include church and religious nonprofit secretary mnuchin it doe although there are some technical issue but yes it doe include faith organization is that under the under the — that ’ s under the sba program secretary mnuchin this is under the ppp yes the new sba program they are covered the president okay thank you all very much secretary mnuchin okay thank you everybody the president thank you jovita thank you steve great job thank you okay so that begin right away and they start handing out check and a lot of people are going to have their business built back up quickly i hope and we ’ ll see it ’ s complicated big small business is actually big business so i thank them both and please — good we have some great gentleman let me see great gentleman that ’ s correct thank you very much today my administration is also issuing new guideline to protect elderly american who remain the most vulnerable by now nursing home should have suspended the entry of all medically unnecessary personnel today we ’ re further recommending that all nursing home facility assign the same staff to care for the same group of resident consistently to minimize any potential spread and we ’ re also urging facility to designate separate area for healthy and sick resident and this is a practice that we probably will be recommending into the future long after the enemy is gone — this particular enemy is gone we ’ re also making every effort to provide relief to our great veteran we take very good care of our veteran at my direction secretary wilkie will use any authority at his disposal to extend deadline for benefit and to postpone debt collection we ’ re now conducting well over coronavirus test per day it ’ s over a thou — a hundred thousand test a day –and these are accurate test and they ’ re moving rapidly — which is more than any other country in the world both in term of the raw number and also on a per caput basis the most the fda ha also authorized the first coronavirus antibody test developed by cellex a key step that will help identify people who have recovered and to understand their immune response and their immune system moment ago i directed secretary azar and acting secretary wolf to use any and all available authority under the defense production act to ensure that domestic manufacturer have the supply they need to produce ventilator for patient with severe case of covid you know what that is right become a very famous term covid — covid this action will help general electric hillrom medtronic resmed royal philip and vyaire medical overcome obstacle in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilator we have over being built right now or soon to be started we anticipate issuing more order under the defense production act in the very near future in addition to the one that i ’ ve just signed against for facemasks — we just signed an element of the act against and hopefully they ’ ll be able to do what they are supposed to do i just spoke to mary barra of general motor and she said they ’ re very soon going to be ready to start production of the ventilator they have a lot of ventilator that they ’ ve committed to build and they ’ ll be starting very very quickly fema continues to deliver resource to area most affected by the virus including new york on top of the bed we ’ re already providing to the javits center the department of defense is adding another icu bed governor cuomo ha asked that this facility go — and it ’ s a big beautiful facility — it be converted to a covid hospital and we hadn ’ t done that yet we hadn ’ t thought in term of doing that but their use is — their real demand is for that and we had meeting on it with the task force we had meeting with the military and i ’ ve decided to say “ yes i ’ m going to do that ” that i will be signing and agreeing to a “ yes ” answer so that — we will be doing that and also we will be staffing it so the federal government is doing a lot of thing that wasn ’ t anticipated that it do this is a — andor can easily be set up — hospital built in javits center and so we ’ re going to be converting that to a hospital and it ’ s going to be staffed by the military and by the federal government and based on the fact that i agreed to that we had two other facility that were likewise asking for it and that would be in louisiana and also in dallas and we ’ ll be doing those we spoke to the governor of louisiana spoke to the governor of texas and we ’ ve told them that we will be staffing those hospital again above and beyond but that ’ s okay we have to do that in addition the usn comfort is docked in new york to accept patient that is a noncovid to date fema ha delivered more than million mask respirator and it ’ s — think of that million four million don ’ t forget we ’ re a secondary source the state are doing it and we ’ re backing them up but we ’ ve gotten million respirator million surgical mask face shield million glove and ventilator just to the city and to the state of new york and some of them now are being sent i spoke with both governor cuomo and mayor de blasio a little while ago and some of them are being sent to the city all of america stand with the people of new york in this time of need it ’ s definitely a hotspot but we have other hotspot also and we ’ re taking them — taking care of them very very strongly very powerfully we have the finest people in the world in those location and i think the federal government ha not only acted early but acted quickly professionally there ’ s no people like this doctor nurse first responder and other healthcare provider who want to help new york at this critical time should visit website nycgovhelpnow nycgovhelpnow they need help now they need people to help them we have great facility and we ’ ve built some brandnew facility big one but we need help we need help for professional people so if you ’ re in an area that isn ’ t so affected and you ’ re a doctor a nurse a healthcare worker please get to that website and we would really appreciate your help new york city need it louisiana by the way need it michigan need it whatever you can do those are very strong hotspot they need help in recent week a the virus ha spread and economic hardship ha followed we have seen american unite with incredible selflessness and compassion i want to remind everyone here in our nation ’ s capital especially in congress that this is not the time for politics endless partisan investigation here we go again have already done extraordinary damage to our country in recent year you see what happens it ’ s witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt and in the end the people doing the witch hunt have been losing and they ’ ve been losing by a lot and it ’ s not any time for witch hunt it ’ s time to get this enemy defeated conducting these partisan investigation in the middle of a pandemic is a really big waste of vital resource time attention and we want to fight for american life not waste time and build up my poll number because that ’ s all they ’ re doing because everyone know it ’ s ridiculous so we want to focus on the people of this country even the people of the world — we ’ re going to be able to help them — because right now a an example we ’ re building so many ventilator — very very hard to build — but we ’ re building thousand thousand of them and a lot of them will be coming at a time when we won ’ t need them a badly because it take time very complex very expensive and we ’ ll be able to help outside of our country we think we ’ ll be able to help that ’ s something that you can not easily produce a citizen we ’ re linked together by the shared bond of national love loyalty and affection there ’ s no earthly force more powerful than the patriotic pride that stir in our heart and that is so true it ’ s incredible the job that everybody ha been doing everybody they don ’ t sleep they don ’ t go to bed sometimes they get nothing i said to somebody recently on the task force “ how many hour ’ sleep have you gotten over the last couple of day the answer wa “ none none in one massachusetts neighborhood citizen come out of their home each night at o ’ clock from their porch and they sing “ god bless america others have joined in spreading from house to house down one street up to the next until their little town with a spirit of patriotism and reminding all american that we ’ re all in this together we ’ ll fight together and we will win together we ’ re going to win this now what i ’ d like to do is — i ’ m going to step out we have a meeting on this subject and i ’ m going to step out just for a few moment i ’ ll be right back we ’ ll answer some question but you have some very hardworking people who have done an incredible job led by vice president mike penny head of the task force and then jared kushner is going to say a few word and admiral polowczyk peter navarro dr birx and myself i ’ ll be right back so i ’ ll see you in a little while i did take a test it just came out this is from the white house physician you may have it it just came out i just took it this morning and i took it it took me literally a minute to take it and it took me i guess it wa or minute i went to work i didn ’ t wait for it but he said it took minute or something to come up with a conclusion and it said “ the president tested negative for so that ’ s the second one i think i took it really out of curiosity to see how quickly it worked and fast it worked and it ’ s a lot easier i ’ ve done them both and the second one is much more pleasant jeff i can tell you that much more pleasant so i ’ ll be back in a little while and mike please take over thank you thank you all very much i ’ ll be right back the vice president thank you mr president the white house coronavirus task force met today but earlier in the day the president convened all the key element of our supply chain team in the oval office for an update on the progress that we have been making working literally around the clock to make sure that our healthcare worker the people on the frontlines have the personal protective equipment and also the ventilator to be able to meet this moment and today you ’ re going to hear from the people that are literally working — working each and every day to make that happen dr deborah birx is also with u she ’ ll reflect in a few moment on the progress that we ’ re making analyzing the data each and every day we ’ re looking county by county state by state consulting with governor and local health official at the present moment more than million test have been performed and a you all are aware some american have tested positive for the coronavirus with now the loss over american and our heart are with their family beyond that we have been focusing not just on ensuring the testing is occurring but that the supply are flowing a the president just announced he made a decision today to deploy thousand of mask directly to new york city ’ s public hospital and our team will speak about that in just a moment and also the president took the unprecedented step to direct the department of defense to use military healthcare personnel to operate all covid facility at the javits center in new york at the convention center in new orleans and at the convention center in dallas and we informed each of the governor of those state today that at their request we were making those military medical personnel available to operate in an allcovid facility but we would emphasize to people in that community who believe you ’ ve been impacted or have contracted the coronavirus contact your local healthcare provider we anticipate in the new york area that your local healthcare provider will make the decision whether you are transferred to the javits center and in all case simply look to the guidance of your local governor about how best to receive the care that every american — every american is entitled to have beyond that let me say that we have been working through fema ’ s acquisition process not only to deploy but to gather up personal protective equipment and in just a few moment you will hear from admiral john polowczyk about the extraordinary progress that we have made in deploying not just the strategic national stockpile but also in identifying on the commercial marketplace around america and around the world literally million of mask surgical gown glove protective equipment and at this point we ’ ve distributed some ventilator and you ’ ll hear today specifically about the state that have received those ventilator we ’ re just — this team ha truly acted in an inspiring way and literally is working with dozen and dozen of people at the fema stabilization task force to make sure that we are leaving no stone unturned to find the supply we need let me also say today you ’ re going to hear from jared kushner senior advisor to the president of the united state but someone that the white house coronavirus task force directed to work with fema on supply chain issue and in recent week he ’ s been leading a working group in conjunction with fema that literally ha identified million of medical supply around the nation and around the world and we ’ re grateful for his effort and his leadership finally you ’ ll hear from peter navarro who will explain the action the president took today using the defense production act but a you hear detail today about medical supply that have been distributed those that have been purchased those that we ’ re making available the ventilator distributed to hospital and those that are available let me just remind every american that you can make a difference in ensuring that every patient ha the treatment that they deserve every healthcare provider every doctor and nurse and nurse ’ s assistant ha the protective gear to provide the care that you would want your family to have by putting into practice the president ’ s “ day to slow the spread ” i mean we want you to take to heart the president ’ s coronavirus guideline for america first to protect your own health to protect the health of your family to protect the health of your community we know so many people are asymptomatic and people that literally don ’ t know they have the coronavirus but have the ability to infect others we want you to put these guideline into practice social distancing using a drivethrough at a restaurant washing your hand on a regular basis but a we focus today on supply make no mistake about it every american can make sure that our healthcare worker and more importantly american that are struggling with coronavirus have the equipment to support their treatment by putting these principle into practice because the fewer american that contract the coronavirus the fewer american will have to enter our healthcare system and that ’ ll continue to preserve the capacity in our healthcare economy so we thank the million of american who have responded in the first two day of “ day to slow the spread and i ’ m just absolutely confident that in the day ahead every american is going to do their part — for your health your family ’ s health the health of your community — and to ensure the strength and vitality of the greatest healthcare system in the world with that let me introduce jared kushner to speak about the work that he ’ s been doing working with fema on ensuring a strong supply chain to meet this moment jared mr kushner thank you mr vice president and thank you for your great leadership on the task force and thank you to dr birx and dr fauci a well it ’ s been an honor working with you these past few week when the vice president first asked me to help on the task force with different task i asked the president what he expected from the task force and how i can best serve him and the task force what the president asked is that all of the recommendation that we make be based on data he wanted u to be very rigorous to make sure that we were studying the data collecting data a lot of thing in this country were happening very quickly and we wanted to make sure that we were trying to keep updating our model and making sure that we were making informed decision and informed recommendation to him based on the data that we were able to collect and put together the president wanted to make sure that we had the people doing the best job and making sure that we had the right people focused on all the thing that needed to happen to make sure that we can deliver in these unusual time for the american people the president also instructed me to make sure that i break down every barrier needed to make sure that the team can succeed this is an effort where the government is doing thing that the government doesn ’ t normally do where we are stretching we ’ re acting very quickly and the president want to make sure that the white house is fully behind the different people running the different line of effort to make sure that we get everything done in a speed that the president demand the president also wanted u to make sure we think outside the box make sure we ’ re finding all the best thinker in the country making sure we ’ re getting all the best idea and that we ’ re doing everything possible to make sure that we can keep american safe and make sure we bring a quick end to this in the best way possible and balance all the different aspect that need to be thought of while we do this this truly is a historic challenge we have not seen something like this in a very very long time but i am very confident that by bringing innovative solution to these hard problem we will make progress today we were briefing the president earlier he asked me to come out and talk a little bit about what we ’ ve doing on the supply chain task force which admiral polowczyk ha been leading and what he ’ s been very impressed by is the way that we ’ ve been resourceful to find product all over the world all over the country and we are finding way to solve the different problem the president ha been very very hand on in this he ’ s really instructed u to leave no stone unturned just this morning — very early this morning — i got a call from the president he told me he wa hearing from friend of his in new york that the new york public hospital system wa running low on critical supply he instructed me this morning i called dr katz who run the system asked him which supply wa the most supply he wa nervous about he told me it wa the mask i asked what his daily burn wa and i basically got that number called up admiral polowczyk made sure we had the inventory we went to the president today and earlier today the president called mayor de blasio to inform him that we were going to send a month of supply to the new york public hospital system to make sure that the worker on the frontline can rest assured that they have the mask that they need to get through the next month we ’ ll be doing similar thing with all the different public hospital that are in the hotspot zone and making sure that we ’ re constantly in communication with the local community one thing i will say just based on data is that we ’ ve been getting a lot of data from different governor and from different mayor and from different city one thing i ’ ve seen fema do very very well over the last week or so is now we ’ re getting realtime data from a lot of city people who have request for different product and supply a lot of them are doing it based on projection which are not the realistic projection the projection change every day a we see the case a we see the impact of the “ stop the spread ” effort that this task force recommended and the president ha been pushing forward so i do think that we ’ ll see that hopefully there ’ ll be impact of that and the task force ha been working very hard through the fema group with admiral polowczyk to make sure that we ’ re getting the supply to people before they run out and making sure that we ’ re doing it in a proper way i ’ d like to just introduce admiral polowczyk who before coming to this — i guess still is — he ’ s the vice director for logistics for the joint staff i got a call from one of the senator saying “ well why don ’ t you put a great military person in charge of the logistics and the supply chain and the defense production act and i said “ well the president already did that this is the best man that we have in the country for supply and logistics he joined the task force day ago over at fema and he ’ s built a team — really at the direction of the vice president — that includes people from fema omb the fda hhs the white house and from everywhere else and what they ’ ve don over the last day ha been really extraordinary we ’ ve done thing that the government ha never done before quicker than they ’ ve ever done it before and what we ’ re seeing now is we found a lot of supply in the country we ’ ve been distributing them where we anticipate there will be need and also trying to make sure that we ’ re hitting place where there are need so i can tell you the people on the — in the task force they ’ re working day and night you ’ ve got a lot of people in the government we recognize the challenge that america face right now we know what a lot of the people on the frontlines are facing the fear that they have that they won ’ t have the supply they need and our goal is to work a hard a we can to make sure that we don ’ t let them down so i just want to thank everybody and with that i want to introduce admiral polowczyk who ’ s doing an amazing job rear admiral polowczyk thank you mr kushner mr vice president so today i ’ m going to cover a couple item — a couple of — five thing the first thing i ’ m going to talk about is resource pushed out from the federal government and then i ’ m going to talk about this air bridge which you may have heard about i ’ m going to talk about data a you said we ’ re — mr kushner is absolutely right we ’ re trying to be data driven and with that i ’ m going to talk a little bit about how we ’ re trying to expand the industrial base here to meet this challenge so the first thing i want to talk about is surgical mask so we ’ ve all — we ’ ve quickly stated number here so these — i ’ m about to go through several different slide to give you just scale and magnitude of federal resource that have been applied at the problem so million surgical mask pushed out to state government for mask million mask and so if i wa — if i wa in a local hospital that wa running short i would — i would look upward because the federal government ha pushed out resource so for protective glove million million pair of protective glove for face shield million face shield for ventilator we have pushed to the state more than ventilator and i think a i wa coming over here that number ha changed slightly i think it ’ s now given to these state — to the predominantly of these state so we wanted you to have some number now a we ’ ve indicated we have ventilator in the national stockpile we pushed ventilator out we ’ re holding ventilator to put to the point of need but we ’ re also buying ventilator asking the industrial base who produce approximately — prior to covid approximately ventilator a year we are going to over the next several month by the end of june work to acquire and so one of the — one of the tool that we ’ re going to — i can anticipate needing — we ’ ve already executed — is all of those vendor that we ’ re buying them from will need — potentially will need help in their supply chain with their supplier we might rate order we might help them get ahead of others in that endeavor so i think mr navarro is going to talk a little bit more on that later so let me talk about the air bridge so it normally take approximately day to get from overseas the product — load it get it to the united state and distribute it that ’ s about day so to prime the pump so to speak we have lined on an air bridge to get product here faster working with our major supplier a they have — a they work to fill order to get more to healthcare worker now we are working to align transportation to product now one of the thing we ’ re also doing is the team that work for me are scouring the globe and finding pocket of personal protective equipment that might not otherwise be in the u hospital supply chain that is also going on these flight six completed and a number scheduled twentyeight flight scheduled here in the near future we ’ re — we are working towards — some day we ’ ll have one flight some day there might be two flight multiple flight over the next coming day these or — a far a i can see out to a couple of week then again matching product to flight to create volume in the supply chain here faster than the day i ’ m just going to leave that up a i talk about a few other item so let ’ s talk about new york city and the public health hospital i believe they ’ re called new york city health and hospital the president directed — a i speak there are pallet being formed truck being loaded i gave an address in new york city here an hour or two ago and one of our distributor is making that happen and that delivery will happen tomorrow on the data front this is almost unprecedented this is a commercial supply chain with six to seven major distributor of health equipment we brought them all in and we said we need to make informed decision and we are going to help make informed allocation decision so within a matter of day feeding from their business system — their enterprise resourcelike system — i brought onboard a tool — a supply chain tower — that the dod wa using to manage a supply chain for a very complex weapon system their data go into a data lake we have a tool to be able to use their data and see it i can tell what product is coming in what their order are what they ’ re filling what they ’ re not filling and see the volume in the supply chain and understand what they ’ re doing down to the county level we ’ re working to get it potentially down to the hospital level so this respirator we took a look in there in the supply chain and we said we can ’ t — we have the volume to go do that i called the distributor and they ’ re making — they ’ re making that happen we anticipate a the hotspot around the country — we anticipate these vendor at our direction helping them allocate product to the right place at the right time so if i can talk finally about expanding the industrial base so the vice president wa at walmart the other day who told him “ i want to get in this game how do i do that so i got the call we provided them specification and now walmart is going to have — use their supplier to cut fabric make gown sew product but that ’ s not always the case we have lot of folk that want to help i believe you will see in the coming day the use of the defense production act in creative way to help people that are not doing this today to do it we have essentially lead — well the number yesterday wa — i believe it probably grew today — that we are working with to find how each one of those might need help to get in the game that ’ s not in the game to increase the throughput through the healthcare market again the president gave me one task get more to our healthcare worker now and i took that to heart because i have — not that i don ’ t need that from the president that direction to move out — but i have family in new york my sister is a nurse practitioner in a westchester hospital and my niece is a nurse on a long island hospital and i have other healthcare professional in the family so i have skin in this game the president asked me to get more to the healthcare worker i ’ m going to get more to healthcare worker i ’ d like to hand it over to mr navarro the vice president inaudible the going out tomorrow — rear admiral polowczyk the is going out a we speak the vice president you might want to be very specific about that rear admiral polowczyk it ’ ll be — it ’ ll be delivered tomorrow can i ask a question the vice president let me — let me be clear on that if i can what jared announced what the admiral just unpacked is that pallet are being loaded right now to send mask — rear admiral polowczyk respirator the vice president — to new york city to the public health hospital rear admiral polowcyzk to the public health warehouse in new york city the vice president to all the healthcare worker help is on the way based on the tool and the data you have available to you where is the logjam where ha it been how have you identified that rear admiral polowcyzk i think — because a you say all this — when we have million more ppes going out the door a you well know the frontline medical worker are not getting it rear admiral polowcyzk so i would answer you — i would answer you this way we put up a lot of number i said that if you ’ re not a — you ’ re in a hospital and you ’ re not seeing ppe i would look up to the state level first but we aren ’ t — we ’ ve hearing from governor sir saying they can ’ t get the medical equipment that they need and the reason for that is because according to governor and also by the fact that we haven ’ t seen any number up there about what is going to the private sector can you tell u what percentage of the supply on these large cargo plane are going to private company versus fema versus the state is it percent rear admiral polowcyzk so fema is — so this product that we ’ re moving is primarily commercial product that would enter the commercial system and be distributed through financial business transaction between hospital and these distributor so just to clarify that that explains why state say they ’ re bidding like they ’ re on ebay because the supply are going to the private sector and then they have to go there to get the supply rear admiral polowcyzk that ’ s normally how thing –that ’ s normally how thing work right so i ’ m not here to disrupt a supply chain and say — look these six distributor — six seven — they have six to seven hundred warehouse they have truck to go to the hospital door every day we ’ re bringing product in they ’ re filling order for hospital nursing home like normal i ’ m putting volume into that system i would say that we have the data now at last — so we put together this data element over the last you know what thirteen day get the people in look at the problem build this i am now seeing truth about what ’ s in the supply chain and i would say that there ’ s been some abnormal behavior okay yes thank you admiral house oversight committee democrat say that fema official told them that the ventilator that the government ha ordered won ’ t be ready until june which is well after the expected peak will the defense production act memo signed today do anything to speed that up rear admiral polowczyk yes it will mr navarro will talk about that we ’ re on line to receive several thousand ventilator in the month of april and several thousand more ventilator in the month of may ramping up to a big number in june again going from you know an industry that produce about annum — annum to a — to a very big number admiral are you confident that this system mean the state with the greatest need are getting the supply rear admiral polowczyk yeah so — because a lot of governor are saying that they can ’ t get what they need and different state have more pressing urgency obviously depending on the caseload rear admiral polowczyk so we marry up — we ’ re marrying up where cdc — where the demand for covid is to what ’ s in the commercial system we ’ re providing that to these — to the commercial system and we are making allocation to those of most pressing need thirteen day — we now have the data we now can make informed decision and so all of the “ i need i need i need ” i now know the volume that ha been happening and need to be happening so admiral with that — and mr president i ’ d love for you to weigh on — the president sure — weigh in on this a well you talk about — well you alluded to the fact there is possibly some shady business going on that the product is here in the united state and — rear admiral polowczyk and coming here yes and it is coming here it ’ s coming from china it ’ s in warehouse it ’ s being made here in the united state it ’ s in warehouse but it ’ s going to the highest bidder so what can be done to keep those product here in the united state not go overseas where company are making a lot of money and — rear admiral polowczyk yeah i ’ m going to let mr navarro talk about that — and get it distributed to the most critical place here in the u the president yeah sure peter go ahead i would love to hear — how is that being done because doctor — i ’ ve talked to surgeon — mr navrrro that ’ s great great — great question — on a regular basis mr navrrro let me — let me give you the — the bigger view of the dpa and we ’ ll directly address that what we have essentially is a nation at war we have a wartime president standing behind me the defense production act is one of the most powerful weapon this administration can use to fight the invisible enemy of the virus when i spoke with you last week i explained the three point of the compass dpa can be used to hit the first one is mobilization of the industrial base this can involve thing like repurposing from say a distiller like pernod ricard — from liquor to hand sanitizer it can also involve expansion of production which is having honeywell — which make mask — opened a new factory in smithfield rhode island with respect to the second point in the compass — allocation of resource — we have two issue there if you look at the manufacturer itself what you want to make sure is that the supply chain which can go seventiers deep ha enough component in that supply chain so we can actually make what we need and then once it ’ s made you also want to make sure that it go to the right — right people and then the third point of the compass which — which address what you ’ re talking about is basically — “ bust ‘ em ” i call it — hoarding of critical or threatened material so let me walk through what — what the president did today in term of a strong action and what we ’ ve done with the dpa across those three point the first order that president trump signed wa vigorous swift it wa the gm order which directed gm to make ventilator in kokomo indiana in trump time — which is to say “ a fast a possible ” a the president mentioned he ’ d spoke to mary barra today the ceo of gm that is moving forward at the same time a the ford project is moving forward in rawsonville michigan and i ’ ve issued a challenge to those two company à la “ ford v ferrari ” — this is ford versus gm let ’ s see who get those ventilator out first now the second point of the compass which these two order address today is this allocation of resource issue the ventilator company themselves expressed concern that in this rush to build ventilator there would be pressure on that supply chain so what they requested that we do and the president do is to use the dpa to give this gentleman here — who ’ s one of the strongest gentleman in the world in term of applying thing — is to give him the ability to prioritize that supply chain for those ventilator manufacturer and he will do thing like give them what ’ s called a “ do rating ” in the defense procurement which will allow them to get what they need now the second order which the president signed today ha to do with the other part of the equation which is once they make the stuff okay doe it go to the right folk and this is a order and to be frank over the last several day we ’ ve had some issue making sure that all of the production that doe around the world — enough of it is coming back here to the right place so what ’ s going to happen with the signing of that order in trump time is we ’ re going to resolve that issue with probably by tomorrow at close of business because we can ’ t afford to lose day or hour or even minute in this crisis now the third part of the compass — this third point there — this get to the hoarding issue the president stood up here with — he ’ s the commanderinchief but we have a sheriff in town too attorney general barr and he stood up here with attorney general barr and bill barr said “ i ’ m going to go out and bust them and guess what three day ago doj went into a warehouse in jersey grabbed ppe and the beauty of that — the beauty of that it wasn ’ t only seized but within hour it wa turned around and given to healthcare professional in new york and new jersey that ’ s a beautiful thing that ’ s a beautiful case of using the dpa now what ’ s going to happen tomorrow is the president is going to sign another order which is in the work this is interesting there is a black market springing up which you have described where we ’ re having people bid against each other broker come in they ’ re bidding and bidding on all this different ppe it ’ s driving the price up and guess what you know where it ’ s going the domestic source here are being exported when president trump heard about that he said “ that ’ s not going to happen anymore under my watch so tomorrow we ’ re bringing that order and what it ’ s going to do is it ’ s going to empower custom and border protection with the help of people like the post office and express mail consigner like ups to basically deal with that issue so we are going to crack down unmercifully and i would say to the hoarder out there and the broker that are trying to make money off of the misery of people in this country around the world that ’ s got to stop and if you ’ ve got inventory what you need to do is pick up a phone and not call somebody out in — around the world you call fema and say “ we got some stuff we ’ ll give it to you at a fair price and be done with that because that stuff ha absolutely got to stop inaudible mr navarro so that ’ s — that ’ s — hang on hang on so that ’ s — that ’ s what we ’ re going to be looking for and when we hear case like this we ’ re going to aggressively issue order after order to crack down on it now before — this is not my role to take a bunch of question but let me tell you one other thing before i leave the podium it ’ s a story which i ’ d love to share with you today because this again illustrates the key principle of this president and this vice president which is to wed the full force of the federal government with the full power of private enterprise and just two day ago we at the white house got an urgent so from the chief of police of the new york police department and they are in a situation now because of the strain on their resource where personnel such a their homicide detective were having to go on into house and deal with covid issue without protective gear now the beauty of this president is because of his leadership we were able to solve that problem in two phone call two phone call the first one went to phebe novakovic at the general dynamic “ phebe can you call tom kennedy at raytheon i need you guy to basically scoop up all the tyvek suit you can and find any glove you can ” this president under his leadership and the voluntary effort and the pride and patriotism you talked about it earlier that — we had tyvek suit delivered to the new york pd within hour that ’ s — that ’ s a new record in trump time at the same time a second phone call wa made the tara engel at pernod ricard and laura lane at ups they were on the same phone call and i said “ tara laura we got this issue they need hand sanitizer literally within two hour we had drum gallon of hand sanitizer on a ups truck heading up to the nypd and it probably arrived today with a promise from pernod that they will continue to supply the nypd throughout the course of this crisis so this is a beautiful thing that america is rallying to we are becoming a stronger more united nation and i couldn ’ t be more proud of this president this administration these guy up here who are doing a heck of a job organizing the supply chain and my promise to you is that the president is going to use that dpa to make sure that the american people particularly our healthcare professional get the ppe the medicine everything we need so let me — let me stop there i don ’ t think it ’ s my place here to field a bunch of question the president no you ’ re doing a good job thank you mr navarro thank you mr navarro what ’ s the status of the “ buy american ” executive order the president go ahead go ahead answer — mr navarro sure the president you go ahead mr navarro okay — the president come here come here come mr navarro one of the — one of the thing that this crisis ha taught u sir is that we are dangerously overdependent on a global supply chain for our medicine like penicillin our medical supply like mask and our medical equipment like ventilator we have — right now a we speak over country have already imposed some form of export restriction in their country against the rest of the world and what we ’ ve — what we ’ re learning from that is that no matter how many treaty you have no matter how many alliance no matter how many phone call when push come to shove you run the risk a a nation of not having what you need and if there ’ s any vindication of the president ’ s “ buy american secure border and a strong manufacturing base ” philosophy strategy and belief it is this crisis — because it underscore everything that we see there so the “ buy american ” order which — which is going through process would do a couple thing it would simply say — not during this crisis because we don ’ t want to disrupt anything i want to be really clear about that but going forward after this is over the va dod hhs and this government buy american for essential medicine our medical countermeasure and the medical supply and equipment we need at the same time it will deregulate so we can get the fda and epa to facilitate domestic manufacturing and then innovate because the key here — the key here is having advanced manufacturing on u soil that can leapfrog other country so we don ’ t have to worry about competing against cheap sweatshop labor lax environmental regulation different tax regime and the massive subsidy of foreign government who are actually directly attacking our industrial base so be patient with that sir it ’ s — the other priority we have right now are to dpa and what the task force is doing but if we learn anything from this crisis it should be never again never again should we have to depend on the rest of the world for our essential medicine and countermeasure the president and by the way we ’ ve cut them out also to be honest we ’ ve stopped order going from certain place and in a couple of place — like we had a big order going to italy on important outfit and some ventilator and it wa going to italy they made the order a long time ago and i said “ you got to let it go they had an order and i could have cut it under the act i could have cut it i said “ nope you can ’ t do that you got to let it go you know they have big problem we had an order going to spain and i said “ let it go i could have stopped it i said “ let it go we ’ re going to be fine i said “ let it go so it work that way also one other thing a to your question oftentimes — and we ’ ve told this to the governor — mike we ’ ve been very strong on this — have — if you think there ’ s bidding between federal government and state let u know and we ’ ll drop out immediately or you drop out and we lower the price but state are bidding against each other the president no no if we ’ re bidding against each other i said find out who it is and usually they know everyone know and we ’ re notified and we get notified and we ’ ll either drop out or they ’ ll drop out but we have another problem there are country out there beyond the state there are country that have this problem and they ’ re ordering too it ’ s really a mess now in a little while the hardest thing to get are the ventilator because they ’ re — you know it take a while to build them and we have a lot we have thousand of them being built right now in a little while they ’ ll be worth about five dollar but right now they ’ re very valuable and we ’ re going to have a lot of them being shipped and in fact that ’ s why general motor called up before — mary that ’ s why others called up two day ago they called up that they ’ re all in production and they ’ ll start — they ’ re starting to arrive in a week and a half but there ’ ll be a time when we ’ re going to build stockpile by the way the state should have been building their stockpile we have almost in our stockpile and we ’ ve been building it and we ’ ve been supplying it but the state should be building we ’ re a backup we ’ re not an ordering clerk we ’ re a backup and we ’ ve done an unbelievable job like for instance who ever heard of a governor calling up “ sir can you build u a hospital of room and we built it “ can you build u four medical center we built it “ can you deliver a ship — a hospital ship — with room and we did it and we did it in los angeles too we ’ ve been an unbelievable — we ’ ve done an unbelievable job — these people and so — and thousand of people behind them but we ’ re a backup ideally those hospital would have had all this equipment ideally those state should have had all this equipment and i think they will the next time you know you heard the case where thousand of ventilator could have been had at a very inexpensive price three year ago and a certain state decided not to exercise that right because they wanted to build a road or they wanted to build something else because it ’ s big money you ’ re talking about — i think it wa a billion dollar but you ’ re talking about a lot of money for something that may never happen because normally on a ventilator — other than a pandemic or an epidemic — you wouldn ’ t — you wouldn ’ t need anything like this hospital have three ventilator — big hospital — and they get by with it and now they want thousand i mean they want thousand of ventilator you call up a governor and he ’ ll say “ sir could you send u ventilator nobody ha ever heard of a thing like this so they ’ ve done some job let me just tell you when secretary mnuchin spoke they want you to call not “ com ” but sbagov — okay — for the application and for information okay so it ’ s sba — small business — sbagov okay if you don ’ t mind yeah let ’ s go please thank you sir thank you mr president i want to follow up from a question yesterday regarding i think your administration ’ s denial of the expansion of obamacare special enrollment period in the wake of this pandemic in your own word — vp penny gave a fiveminute nonanswer — but people facing this pandemic — illness and even worse — most expert say that having healthcare is critical to our nation ’ s health and financial wellbeing the president right can you assure american tonight that you will reopen obamacare marketplace so that they can be covered in this time of combined health — the president well we ’ re — we ’ re doing better than that — and financial crisis the president yeah no i understand the question and we ’ re doing better than that we ’ re going to try and get a cash payment to the people and we ’ re working out the mechanic of that with legislature so we ’ re going to try and get them a cash payment because just opening it up doesn ’ t help a much so we ’ re going to work it out so we ’ re going to try and get for that certain group of people — it ’ s a certain group of people — a cash payment go ahead i really want to ask you about mask but i also just wanted to follow up on a couple of hanging thread there on just the question earlier about the bidding what happens though when state are bidding against each other on those market the president well they have that and they have to work that out what they should do is they should have — long before this pandemic arrived they should have been on the open market just buying there wa no competition you could have made a great price the state have to stock up it ’ s like one of those thing they waited they didn ’ t want to spend the money because they thought this would never happen and their shelf in some case were bare and by the way in some case they weren ’ t they were beautifully serviced they did a good job but in some case their shelf were bare so the best thing they can do is when time become normalized — and they will hopefully soon — and actually you ’ re going to have a lot of excess material because so much is being done right now in term of protective gear protective outfit a lot is being done it ’ s going to be — within six month it ’ s going to be sold for the right price they got to stack up for the next time but we are doing that and the admiral ha done a fantastic job senator schumer wrote a letter today and he say “ you should put a military man in charge i said “ well chuck if you knew a little bit more we have one of the most highly respected people in the military the admiral this is what he doe too very professionally and he ’ s in charge but chuck didn ’ t know that okay jeff please mr president you tweeted this morning about your call with saudi arabia ’ s mb the president yeah we ’ ve had some people say that the figure that you cited — between million and million barrel per day — is not what they ’ re agreeing to can you be more specific about what exactly they told u the president i don ’ t know what they ’ re agreeing to i think they might agree to more than that look russia — russia — did he tell you that sir the president yeah he did say that actually russia talked about million barrel russia and saudi arabia are fighting over this and a everybody know it ’ s you know really killing an industry hurting russia badly hurting saudi arabia badly i said “ this is an easy one it should be an easy one and it may be and it may be more than that i wa actually told it may be a i told somebody before it may be and it may be more than that maybe it ’ s maybe it go up to could be a high a and you know there ’ s a tremendous oversupply right now that industry wa — it wa oversupplied before the virus and when the virus came along they lost percent of the world and there ’ s an unbelievable — you can ’ t get a ship now every ship is loaded to the gill sitting out someplace in the ocean they ’ re storage tank they ’ re not even ship they ’ re storage tank so it would be great for russia it would be great for saudi arabia i hope they make that deal but that ’ s what they told me they said — inaudible million be — the president — they said it ’ s — — enough to address the oversupply issue the president well i think it will be hopefully soon i think hopefully they ’ ll announce something soon now can a deal be broken can something happen where it doesn ’ t happen i guess in which case there ’ s another alternative but i ’ d rather not see that other alternative i hope they can make a deal what do you mean when you say the “ alternative ” the president they both want — i think they both want to make a deal and they ’ re both smart they love their country they want to make a deal it ’ s good but it ’ s also good for the world if they do because you save an industry mr president — the president yeah please go ahead go ahead in the back please what do you by “ cash payment ” the president i ’ m going to let mike because we went over this very specifically and i ’ ll let you talk about it mike because you responded last time the vice president right thank you mr president a i said yesterday the president ha put a priority on ensuring that no american ha to worry about the cost of coronavirus testing and we ’ ve been working every day to make sure that american don ’ t have to worry about the cost of treatment and at this point the white house coronavirus task force is working on a proposal for the president to use some of the billion that we ’ re making available to hospital to compensate the hospital directly for any coronavirus treatment that they provide to uninsured american we ’ re working out the detail of that the president will make a final decision tomorrow we expect an announcement but the president ha made it very clear we don ’ t want american to worry about the cost of getting a test or the cost of getting treatment and we ’ ve expanded coverage through medicaid we ’ ve expanded coverage through medicare health insurance company around the country including blue cross just today announced that all of their member will be waiving all copayments on coronavirus treatment but for those some million uninsured american the president ha directed the coronavirus task force to find a way to make sure that they know we will find a way to pay for your coronavirus treatment and the president will be addressing that and announcing that tomorrow mr president — the president go ahead — a point of clarification and then a followup question yesterday you said that you spoke to florida governor ron desantis before he issued his stayathome order did you advise him to issue that order the president no but i talked to him about it and he want to do what ’ s right for the people of florida he ’ s been a great governor you could see that just by his popularity which is extraordinary we ’ re proud of him he ’ s done a fantastic job and he made the decision but we spoke before he made the decision yes and he had also said that he is considering putting people who are suspected of having coronavirus or who have tested for positive for it in isolation center and that he would potentially use — the president that i haven ’ t heard no that i haven ’ t heard so he hasn ’ t consulted with you the president i haven ’ t heard that yes please thank you mr president ebony bowden from the new york post a few hour ago mayor de blasio the mayor of new york said that new yorkers leaving their home should wear mask they should also wear mask when they ’ re with other people are you considering that kind of recommendation on a federal level and if you are how would you prevent a rush on mask the president well i think they ’ re going to be coming out with regulation on that and if people want to abide by them frankly i don ’ t think you — i don ’ t think there ’ ll be mandatory because some people don ’ t want to do that but if people wanted — a an example on the mask if people wanted to wear them they can if people wanted to use scarf which they have — many people have them — they can in many case the scarf is better it ’ s thicker i mean you can — if you — depending on the material it ’ s thicker but they can do that if they want now a recommendation is coming out we ’ ll see what that recommendation is but — is that a cdc recommendation sir the president but i will say this they can pretty much decide for themselves right now would that be nationwide and can i also just ask– the president nationwide nationwide — the president yeah — not just for hotspot and then i think this is best for dr birx but we ’ ve heard some differing guidance here the who and even the surgeon general have talked about various study that show that mask in addition to maybe not even being helpful to protecting people may actually increase the rate of illness because people touch the mask then they touch themselves the president sure can you talk a little bit about just the evolution of — the president all right maybe i will ask — — your thinking on this the president — dr birx and you might mention that other point also yeah thanks dr birx no no thank you so i hope you got from the conference today that we ’ re triangulating data that we know from the case number the testing number the supplychain number to create an integrated picture so that we can really support hospital in their need and i think that level of granularity is really critical secondly i just want to make the point that we really applaud the governor that are looking at a wholeofstate or a wholeofmetro approach and what do i mean by that the united state going into this had about ventilator across the united state and another to anesthesia machine that ’ s about five time what most of the european country have but it ’ s a matter of distribution to need and i really applaud the governor that are bringing together their public hospital with their more private hospital and their visibility across their state because what we tried to talk about yesterday is every state every county is different and that ’ s why we ’ re looking at it at that level of granularity and a we move through this epidemic the need need to be very tailored to those county and frankly those hospital i mean there ’ s a reason why the president and mr kushner have been very much involved in finding out what the public hospital need why is that because the public hospital sometimes have the weakest supply chain because they ’ re often sometimes not a attractive to private sector distributor or they may be too busy caring for the need of patient to be really on top of their order form and their supply chain so really listening to the community that ’ s at the front of this fight and getting feedback from those specific community no matter where they are and listening to the frontline healthcare worker because it ’ s their reality that is important to all of u whether you ’ re the mayor or the governor or the federal government and if they ’ re saying they need something we have to work together to supply that and so that ’ s what you ’ re seeing with this triangulation every county will move through this differently and that allows u to move around these vital issue that protect the frontline healthcare worker and protect the patient through the ventilator to make sure that the supply chain is aligned with the need a it happens now you have to have very good data in order to be willing to work in that level of granularity and that ’ s what we ’ ve been working on to really develop that level of granularity to ensure that so i just wanted to say one other thing about testing just to give you the bottomline data of what we ’ re seeing we appreciate the group who are reporting not everyone is reporting yet and this is part of u trying to understand at a very granular level we do have two state that do have percent positive and that ’ s new york and new jersey so that confirms very clearly that that ’ s a very clear and important hot zone louisiana though ha percent of their test are positive michigan connecticut indiana georgia illinois — so that should tell you where the next hotspot are coming — are at percent test positive and then colorado dc rhode island and massachusetts are at percent there ’ s a significant number of state still under percent everyone that i didn ’ t discus california and washington remain steady at an percent rate so what we ’ re seeing finally is testing improving — more testing being done still a high level of negative — in state without hotspot allowing them to do more of the surveillance and containment and then prioritizing this new rapid test kit to those area that may not have the same amount of access — to the indian health service and to the public health institution and the public health and state lab so that they can use that and start forward leaning into surveillance now we know there are people waiting for test and they ’ re waiting for test because when these area became very — when they got onto the logarithmic curve we prioritized people whose decision — where the test decision would make it critical for their care and so we prioritized hospital and we prioritized nurse and doctor and frontline worker the president good dr birx so that mean if you went through a drivethrough or you went through your doctor you could have that delay so the mask so what i tried to give you is how we ’ re using data in a very granular way and so there are — there is experiential data when you look at community that have oftentimes utilized mask — in general for personal protection — from when they particularly are themselves sick and have used their mask in public and we ’ ve looked at the rate of this in those population and then we ’ re looking at the scientific evidence to bring those two piece together let me just say one thing though the most important thing is the social distancing and washing your hand and we don ’ t want people to get an artificial sense of protection because they ’ re behind a mask because if they ’ re touching thing — remember your eye are not in the mask so if you ’ re touching thing and then touching your eye you ’ re exposing yourself in the same way so we don ’ t want people to feel like “ oh i ’ m wearing a mask i ’ m protected and i ’ m protecting others you may be protecting others but don ’ t get a false sense of security that that mask is protecting you exclusively from getting infected because there are other way that you can get infected because of the number of asymptomatic and mild case that are out there and so this worry u and that ’ s why the debate is continuing about the mask because we don ’ t want — when we ’ re trying to send a signal that every single person in this country need to stay six foot away from everybody that need to be washing their hand constantly and know where their hand are — to send a signal that we think a mask is equivalent to those piece so in the — when the advisory come out it will be an additive piece if it come out rather than saying “ this is a substitute for… and we want to make sure everybody understands it is not a substitute for the presidential guideline that have already gone out and to be absolutely clear about that dr birx can i ask a follow up about the testing please the president go ahead dr birx there ’ s a lot of evidence we ’ re seeing — that the expert are saying that a high number of these test could be producing false — false negative so — dr birx of the roche and abbott test that a many a one in three test might be providing false negative and i wa wondering — maybe you could explain or — dr birx that would be almost be impossible with — — tell a little about the science dr birx — having percent positive you — if that wa true you would have percent positive — are you concerned about the underlying data — dr birx — or percent positive so what i can tell you is the number of positive test is tracking very closely with the number of case diagnosed so i don ’ t — i will look into that i look at the roche and abbott number every night they ’ re trending exactly in the same way and that ’ s important when you ’ re validating data to really validate “ doe this same site ” — in other word i ’ m looking between testing site to see are there consistency is there an anomaly to make sure for what you just very specifically asked so i will go back and look at it more carefully i haven ’ t seen that kind of anomaly this is — this same platform is being used across the country and that ’ s a range from what i reported percent positivity up to percent positivity and that range reflects also what we ’ re seeing with the hotspot and the number of case and frankly – i mean we hate to talk about it but it also track with the hospitalization independent of diagnosis and the mortality that we ’ re seeing so all of those piece validate together there ’ s no concern that there might – people might be getting a false sense of security or that we might not be seeing all of the data here on – and who ha it dr birx well i ’ m telling you i ’ m still missing percent of the data from reporting i have test reported in we ’ ve done million so there is — and it could be those site so we do need to see all — the bill said you need to report we ’ re still not receiving percent of the test dr birx with regard to the test the president ’ s sample collection took one minute result reported back in minute i realize you ’ re the president of the united state but when will everyone get to take a test that work that quickly and you get result that quickly dr birx so these are new test and we have prioritized the group that we think have the least access to testing now and who do we mean by that we mean the indian health service — they ’ re often in remote area rural area the governor of the northwestern state that may not have the advantage of these highthroughput machine that are often across the east coast and in high metro area — colorado — and then across the west coast so we ’ ve prioritized the presidential test to the indian health service and public health lab so that they can support nursing home testing and other area where we think surveillance is absolutely key so at this moment they ’ re prioritized in that way the vice president it ’ s thirteen to twelve hundred dr birx yes of them are going out that way so do more of those test need to be made in order for more people — the president they are being made dr birx yeah okay so in a matter of – the president they ’ re moving very quickly — it ’ s happening — in this case dr birx so i ’ m glad you asked that because today there ’ s of these machine already out there we ’ re trying to find out exactly where everyone is because you can see that give you amazing flexibility because if people would allow it to be loaned to a state that ’ s in a hotspot or a state where you want to do additional surveillance test machine is a huge amount and it really get to your very question about how we can prioritize what we have at the same time we ’ re moving out what is new and so really figuring out who should those go to how — who can we ask community — because these will be in the community — to share those machine into the community who need the testing now and i think that ’ s really an incredible question that really need to be answered over the next hour dr birx a point of clarity about the facecovering guidance you said it ’ s still a point of debate you said — you used the phrase “ the guidance if it come out is the guidance coming out and when the vice president yes yes and — and when sir the vice president in the — in the day ahead we ’ re currently working through the task force taking the consultation advice of cdc our top health expert and we ’ ll be bringing forward the guidance from the cdc in the next several day dr birx just remember it ’ s not a substitute for everything that we ’ re asking people to do and just to — to everybody out there across the country when we say no gathering of we ’ re looking at — we want it to be clear if you have a family of we don ’ t want you to be split up but we don ’ t expect people to be having dinner party cocktail party i mean i know you ’ ve seen the slope in the united state versus the slope in italy and we have to change that slope we have to change the logarithmic curve that we ’ re on we see country after country having done that what it mean in the united state is not everyone is doing it so we ’ re only a strong a every community every county every state every american following the guideline to a t and i can tell by the curve and a it is today that not every american is following it and so this is really a call to action we see spain we see italy we see france we see germany when we see others beginning to bend their curve we can bend ours but it mean everybody ha to take that same responsibility a american mr president dr birx doe that mean — mr president can i have a quick followup on oil please in your conversation with russia and saudi arabia did you have to make any concession to get them to agree to cut their production the president no like did you agree to cut u production of oil the president no no we didn ’ t discus that they want to do that that ’ s good for their country and we did not discus that now mr president nbc news ha learned that the navy is set to fire the captain of the us theodore roosevelt after he raised red flag about the outbreak on his ship it appears a if he ’ s being punished for trying to save the life of the sailor in his command what ’ s your assessment the president oh i don ’ t think so at all but we ’ re going to wait a little while because i understand there ’ s a news conference by the secretary of defense about that but you know i don ’ t — i don ’ t agree with that at all not at all not even a little bit yeah mr president thank you this morning you said once again that new york got off to a late start and they should have pushed harder but governor and other state leader say they rely on the federal government to ass the situation and how risky it is and they want to know how would they have known to start sooner without your guidance the president well they have expert and frankly long after we came out and talked about it — look how would i have known to cut off china i cut off china very early and if i didn ’ t we would have a chart that you wouldn ’ t believe so how would i know to do that how would i know to cut off europe i cut off europe very early i mean you have to make a decision people knew that some bad thing were going on and they got off to a late start and some others got off to a late start also but we cut off china if we didn ’ t cut off china we would have been in some big trouble and we cut it off but do — the president and you know what we cut it off way early go ahead mr president to follow up on the insurance point and a separate question that came in from a colleague who can ’ t be in the room — the president too bad on the insurance point is there going to — the president who are you with who are you with roll call is there going to be an opportunity for insurance company — if in fact hospital are compensated for uncompensated care – the president right right — are the insurance company going to also get compensated for extraordinary expense that they may have or are they assuming that cost the president so we haven ’ t discussed it but we ’ re talking to them you know getting them not to pay copays in the case of the big one wa a tremendous thing that ’ s a lot of money they gave up but we ’ re discussing that with the insurance company okay the president we ’ ll let you know it ’ ll be pretty quickly yeah go ahead on — i have a question on japan sir they are expanding their entry ban to include the united state are you planning to take any similar action to ban japanese national from coming to the u a a result of this crisis the president well we ’ re looking at a lot of thing and a lot of different ban we have more ban than anybody we had ban when ban weren ’ t fashionable if you remember right at the beginning of this administration it wa for different reason but we ’ ve had ban long before people thought of ban when i did china it had never been done before i wa the first one to do it remember that it had never — according to what i read in all the paper this had never been done this is a terrible thing to do and four week later they were all saying “ we ’ re lucky we did it so we ’ re looking at it no we heard that and i think it ’ s fine that they do that they ’ re trying to protect their country and we have to protect our country yeah please mr president – mr president i asked you yesterday about stayathome order – the president yeah — and if that you know decision should be left in the hand of governor or if you ’ re considering telling the entire nation “ stay at home ” the president yeah so just today the — georgia ’ s governor finally issued a stayathome order – the president yeah — saying that individual could have been infecting people before they ever felt bad but we didn ’ t know that until the last hour is that ignorance gross incompetence the president he ’ s a good governor brian kemp he ’ s a very good – you ’ ve been having call with these governor the president he ’ s a good governor and he ha to make his own decision on that i let the state — i think we ’ re about percent positive on that if you look i think it ’ s about percent of the state have got the stayathome brian is a great governor we ’ ll — it ’ s his decision he made that decision ultimately he decided to go along with it do you think it wa smart decision to wait the president and they ’ re doing — and they ’ re doing well and the state is doing well in many respect yeah go ahead please this is another question from a colleague who couldn ’ t make it in today from emily goodin at the daily mail i had a question in regard to the russian plane that landed at jfk with medical supply did the united state ask russia for this aid or is it just accepting it the president we ’ re accepting it it wa a very nice offer from president putin i spoke to him the other night a i told you and they had excess medical equipment thing and i ’ ll take it i ’ ll take it he just offered you — the president i think it ’ s very nice we ’ ve had some from china we also help other country we like doing that like i said before if we have excess stuff we let it go out we let some go out where frankly they had order for it and i didn ’ t want to stop order it wa a very nice gesture on behalf of president putin and i could ’ ve said “ no thank you ” or i could have said “ thank you and it wa a large plane of very highquality medical supply and i said “ i ’ ll take it ” is he offering any further aid in your conversation the president i think he would if we asked for it but he wa very nice it wa part of the call he suggested — he said “ we have it it ’ s additional they have very big difficulty with this virus also a you know — russia i thought it wa a very nice gesture on behalf of president putin i could have said “ no i don ’ t want it ” or i could have said “ i ’ ll take it and you know what i said “ i ’ ll take it ” and would you accept further aid the president i think so yeah if they sent thing that we need i ’ d take it sure nice gesture are there concern about russian using it a propaganda the president i ’ m not concerned about russian propaganda not even a little bit he offered a lot of medical highquality stuff that i accepted and that may save a lot of life i ’ ll take it every day please in the back mr president you said — in january you tweeted that you stand with the people of iran since the beginning of your presidency and you ’ ll continue to stand with the people of iran given the fact that they ’ re so hard hit with the coronavirus — the president oh they ’ re very hard hit they ’ re very hard hit but would you consider — the president in a lot of way they ’ re hard hit they ’ re hit in — with their economy with their military and with obviously the virus they ’ re very hard hit would you consider easing sanction to allow medical supply to get in the president well they haven ’ t even asked u to do that okay but we know that sanction hit the people not the government the president you know what they haven ’ t even asked u to do that but how doe a person — the president if they want to meet we ’ d love to meet and we ’ d love to settle the whole thing out but i doubt they ’ ll be — but how doe a — realistically how doe a person in tehran pick up the phone and call you i mean — the president i think they love america i think the iranian love america i think they ’ d love to be free i think they ’ d love to have just some of the thing that we have you know i remember iran many year ago — friend of mine were always in iran they were doing real estate deal in iran they were building beautiful building all over iran apartment house it wa — they were very successful and then one day that came to an end but you know what the people of iran they remember that it wa a long time ago but not so long ago and they remember it and i ’ ll tell you they love america they love what we stand for and we ’ re not looking for cha — we ’ re not looking for government takeover government change you know this country ha been through that many time that doesn ’ t work so inaudible health of the people would you encourage other country to — who are maybe concerned about running afoul — the president well what i did — yeah what i did a you know — — of sanction to — the president — i put it out very publicly with respect to iran i said if they need help with respect to the virus we ’ d love to send — we have the greatest medical professional in the world we ’ d love to send them over so what country are you encouraging perhaps to — to lend their support because there are many country that feel — the president i ’ m not encouraging or discouraging they ’ ve been a very hostile country they made a deal that president obama should have never made it wa a shortterm deal giving them billion giving them billion in cash green fill up this room five time look — but your administration — do you have a moral responsibility to — the president no not at all nobody ha even asked me about it i have a moral responsibility to help them if they ask if they — if they needed help i would certainly consider different thing well the united nation say they need help the president well that ’ s up to the united nation i ’ m talking about u and what happens is if they wanted help — because they have a very big case of virus a very very big case it — one of the worst on earth if you believe what you ’ re reading and i happen to believe what i see and what i know and if they wanted help we ’ d give them help yeah you had one in the back please yes mr president and a question for jared too the — you talk about a granular approach to receiving data from these different state and region to try and figure out what they need the president — you just enacted the dpa on ventilator and mask are there are signal from across the country that might indicate there are other thing besides mask and ventilator that are slowly kind of rising in term of need — like hand sanitizer for instance the president go ahead mr kushner sure so the first — the first issue that we ’ ve been dealing with wa really the ventilator that wa the number one number two and number three from all the state what we ’ ve been finding is that people have a lot of these request based on the model and what we ’ ve been trying to do over at fema is say to the state “ well if you would like ventilator we need to see — first look in your state right so for example in northern jersey they ’ re going down to southern jersey and they ’ re finding ventilator and trying to relocate them to where they have their hotspot the second thing that we ’ ve done asked them to survey for alternative ventilator dr birx spoke before about the anesthesia machine and the ability to — to convert them to be ventilator so we ’ re asking people to be resourceful inside their state before they come to the federal government the third thing we ’ ve been asking state to do is to provide what their daily utilization rate are so everyone is asking for everything one congressman got a call from his local hospital saying “ i need ventilator and he said “ well you don ’ t have a covid patient within four county why do you want ventilator and he say “ well we just want to be safe we ’ re very nervous right now ” so what you have all over the country is a lot of people are asking for thing that they don ’ t necessarily need at the moment and the job of fema and admiral polowczyk ha been to try to make sure that we ’ re getting the real data from the city from the state so that we can make realtime allocation decision based on the data and right now what ’ s happening is a lot of the different city and state are providing fema that — that information we ’ re talking to them daily they ’ re updating that information daily and that ’ s enabling the federal government to make much more informed decision on where they position ventilator you also have a situation where in some state fema allocated ventilator to the state and you have instance where in city they ’ re running out but the state still ha a stockpile and the notion of the federal stockpile wa it ’ s supposed to be our stockpile it ’ s not supposed to be state stockpile that they then use so we ’ re encouraging the state to make sure that they ’ re assessing the need they ’ re getting the data from their local — local situation and then trying to fill it with the supply that we ’ ve given them the same thing with the mask so the mask is actually an item that wasn ’ t used a frequently in the medical profession before this it wa used mostly for disease so speaking to a lot of the doctor and hospital administrator they would say they used actually a very low percentage of the mask what the president and the vice president were able to do with congress wa to get the waiver so that you could expand the pool because a lot of the mask were used to — for the construction industry now there ’ s a much bigger pool of mask in the country there wa a stockpile they distributed that based on where they anticipated a lot of the need would go but a lot of that still is stuck with the state and it hasn ’ t trickled down to the right place within the state so i would just encourage you when you have governor saying that the federal government haven ’ t — hasn ’ t given them what they need i would just urge you to ask them “ well have you looked within your state to make sure that you haven ’ t been able to find the resource ” unlike other country a lot of the medical system in america is a private — it ’ s not a — it ’ s not a public governmentcontrolled so you have to get the data from what ’ s in their state look at it in that way and then make sure that they ’ re being resourceful in a way to do that and also ask them what their utilization percentage is because if one governor is asking for more ventilator and if the federal government sends them more than they need the goal here is not to have ventilator sitting in a warehouse where you have another state or you have people who need them so what we ’ re trying to do is make informed datadriven decision both on ventilator mask any other supply we can get to make sure it ’ s going to the people who need them i wonder if you could weigh in on the report of which i ’ m sure you ’ re aware where unnamed white house official have described your role a being something of running a shadow task force how do you describe your role how do you describe the qualification you bring to your role mr kushner yeah i would just say very simply — look the president asked the vice president to run the task force the vice president asked me to assist i ’ ve been serving really at the direction of vice president and he ’ s asked me to get involved in different project the vice president and i speak probably sometimes time a day but everything that i ’ m doing is at the direction of the vice president if some people are talking to you that mean they ’ re probably not informed a to what ’ s going on but i can assure you that i ’ m speaking with dr birx dr fauci the vice president and the president multiple time a day to make sure that i ’ m accomplishing and focusing on the objective that the vice president deems a priority jared a followup on the ventilator — the president or they don ’ t exist — and the national stockpile the president or the source don ’ t exist they ’ re fake person okay a lot of fake source out there they don ’ t exist i read about it — for a long time i ’ ve been reading a lot of them — fake source they don ’ t exist go ahead please thank you mr president jared what trigger sending a ventilator from the national stockpile to a state in other word how sick doe somebody have to be to get one of these national ventilator mr kushner well that ’ s not the issue that we ’ re — that ’ s not the criterion you have the state basically putting in the request and they ’ re giving u their utilization — their utilization percentage so it ’ s a very simple formula the state should know how many ventilator they have in their state and by the way some governor you speak to or senator they don ’ t know what ’ s in their state you know some governor i ’ ll speak to and they ’ ll know to the number how many ventilator they have in their state because that ’ s the first thing a good manager will do what a lot of the voter are seeing now is that when you elect somebody to be a mayor or a governor or a president you ’ re trying to think about who will be a competent manager during the time of crisis this is a time of crisis and you ’ re seeing certain people are better manager than others so what i would say is that the way that the federal government is trying to allocate is they ’ re trying to make sure a you have your data right don ’ t ask u for thing when you know that — when you don ’ t know what you have in your own state just because you ’ re scared you asked your medical professional and they don ’ t know you have to take inventory of what you have in your own state and then you have to be able to show that there ’ s a real need and so we prepositioned a lot of thing because most governor off the bat didn ’ t know what they needed but fema ha a joint command with admiral polowczyk admiral giroir and pete gaynor where every couple hour when their request come in they evaluate the request they all vote on the request and then if there is something that they want to elevate to the taskforce they bring it to the vice president to make a recommendation the vice president and jared if i may you might ask deborah to — we ’ re literally tracking hospitalization case on a daily basis interacting with governor and health system and that informs our supply chain decision dr birx yeah i really — i want to thank the health commissioner and all of them that have been sending hospital data and i think it ’ s really critical and important to all of u new york city ha been providing information new jersey connecticut rhode island and certainly louisiana in these hotspot and that allows u — we can see where they are with the rising number of case where they are in their curve what can be predicted and really ensuring that people get what they need a they need it and so i think many of the governor now and the health commissioner have been “ i had to use ” — “ i ’ m intubating people a day now i have enough for th next three day if that doubles…we ’ re seeing our hospitalization rate stabilizing but we still think there will be this many more in the next day that ’ s the information that they then translate into providing the ventilator so when you see the ventilator number going out they ’ re going out in and because i think early on we sent a big bolus out and then not all of them even today have been fully utilized and so we want to make sure every state and every hotspot can be reassured that ventilator are there for them a they move through the curve and i think to date we ’ ve been able to do that and i think that ’ s what ’ s important to me is that people have what they need when they need it and to date people who have needed ventilator have been able to get on ventilator and i think that ’ s our goal with governor and with the mayor to make sure that that continues to happen but that mean all of u have to work together and i think that ’ s what ’ s been really important over the last few week is people are not making generic request anymore they ’ re making datadriven request because they know precisely what ’ s happening in their hospital dr birx when you are up here a little bit ago you talked about the curve and what you ’ re seeing and you ’ re concerned that people are not abiding by the social distancing guideline i mean you seemed in your voice to be quite concerned about that ha the curve changed enough at this point where that to people are likely to die ha that shifted upwards at all dr birx no it ’ s just when i look at what — so we ’ re in week in our guideline and i guess what i expected when the president put out guideline that said “ don ’ t go to bar don ’ t be in group more than people ” when we said that now over day ago that wa serious and then you could see what happened subsequently and you can see the number of individual have been infected since then because the people we ’ re seeing infected today and in hospital today were infected after the guideline went out so that ’ s what we ’ re worried about and we ’ re worried about that we ’ re not — we ’ re still in this and that ’ s why the president extended it for day but we have to get out of this we have to start seeing this the president but deborah aren ’ t you referring to just a few state because many of those state are dead flat i mean so — dr birx yes the president so it ’ s hard to get — it ’ s hard to be — dr birx yes there are state that are dead flat but you know every — what change the curve is a new detroit a new chicago a new new orleans a new colorado those change the curve because it all of a sudden spike with the number of new case because you have a certain projection of new case and then a whole other city come on top where they ’ re in their logarithmic phase so those one that i talked about that had test result greater than percent positive all of those — all of those state or all of those county are in logarithmic phase that mean there are a lot of county that aren ’ t and we are really — we ’ re excited about those county that have been testing and still finding quite flat and hopefully maybe sunday or so or sometime this weekend we can go through all the state and the curve again so you can see where you know that california and washington are still steady but we ’ re watching very carefully because we see that you can go from this to this very quickly and what — this should not be happening any longer in new place if people are doing the social distancing washing their hand not getting together in large group more than the president again so i look at the graph all the time dr birx yes you do the president and you have many many — dr birx yes the president — flatliners i call them “ flatliners i ’ m amazed at them and you have a couple that are up it ’ s hard to blame the flatliners for not doing a good job dr birx no no i don ’ t want to say that no i don ’ t — no thank you sir i don ’ t want — in fact i want to praise the state that — and i think i want to be able to call them out and show you their graph so you can see they ’ ve had steady small case they ’ re testing and they ’ re doing a lot of testing and their percent of testpositives are under percent i mean we have a whole group of state who are testing and their positivity rate is under percent we know what it look like on the logarithmic curve you ’ re in the percent then percent then percent and then percent that ’ s what we ’ re trying to prevent and it ’ s the metro area that are absolutely crucial in this and so if you ’ re in a metro area or you ’ re in a small city please make sure all of your friend and family are following the guideline that ’ s the best thing we can do the president no because i saw those pen going five minute ago they were so — they were thrilled and the fact is — yes we compare them to italy one place but we have many place that are — dr birx yes the president — really doing great and i think that ’ s what deborah meant she didn ’ t mean all of them so when you write your story tomorrow maybe you ’ ll write it correctly she wa talking about one state and another state is you know having a hard time it ’ s — and they ’ re closely associated and by the way the people are doing a very good job including the people that live there but when deborah wa talking about italy she wa talking about the one and then the other wa lower and then you have mostly state that have been unbelievable so she wasn ’ t talking about the average of everything she wa talking about an individual state which is i think still better than italy italy is having a hard time by the way spain is having a hard time france is having a hard time but our state generally speaking it ’ s like lot of different country all over we have — many of those country are doing a phenomenal job they ’ re really flat and i think that ’ s what you meant dr birx thank you sir the president i don ’ t know i don ’ t want to — i don ’ t want to speak for — but i thought — that ’ s what i understood she meant yeah please can i ask a question about that though because coronavirus is present in all state you said before that you — when you implored mayor and governor to be serious about this you said “ once it show up mitigation effort are too late ” so how do you then square that with this notion that some state are doing well i mean the virus doesn ’ t abide by state law the president because some state they stay in better they ’ re not touching they ’ re not — whatever it is they ’ re not going out they ’ re not in group and some state are not probably a good or for whatever reason or they also live a lot closer you know new york is very dense and you know california is pretty dense too and they ’ ve got a very good record going so far we hope it doesn ’ t spike up but it ’ s very flat we have state that are doing incredibly well i mean when i looked at some of them i looked at some state that i would have thought maybe wouldn ’ t have done a well and they ’ re really flatlined hope they stay that way i hope they stay that way isn ’ t that the point mr president the president say it jeff sir isn ’ t that the point that you want those state to stay flatlined the president i want them — yeah that ’ s what i ’ m saying i mean it seems like you ’ re — the president no no no but when deborah mentioned about italy and our country she wasn ’ t referring to our country she wa referring to one state but she ’ s encouraging people to do a better job of following these social distancing measure that ’ s what i ’ m understanding it the president okay so my understanding — i ’ m going to let her say it but i think that everybody would have to be thrilled with the way most state are doing thrilled i don ’ t think she — is that what you meant the president the flatline — the flatline state — state that have almost no bump i mean i would think now then you have others where for whatever reason they ’ re higher that ’ s different but you can ’ t condemn people living in a flatliner with people living in something where there ’ s the big bump or the bigger bump or more akin to italy where they have some very unique problem in all fairness to italy they have some very unique problem but if you ’ d like to come up and — so how many flatline do we have the president a lot of them and how many do we have — how many how many do we have dr birx so why don ’ t i bring you the whole deck again and we ’ ll divide out the state so you can see them the vice president we ’ ll do it tomorrow dr birx because you really have to see each state separately that ’ s why i started with there are state where you ’ ve heard me talk about how concerned i wa these are state that before the guideline went out or right after the guideline went out — i mean you can look at — it ’ s on the website if you go to the healthdataorg about when governor made clarity about closing their state a far a the social distancing the washing of the hand the bar the taking — doing takeout and you can line that up with the presidential guideline and not all state when the presidential guideline came out immediately followed the presidential guideline not all state did there are state that also may have gotten many more seed from outside community that certainly is one of the issue that new york and new jersey connecticut and rhode island are facing the virus came in from multiple place into those state it wa undetected early on and they have a very logarithmic curve what i am saying is even one of those curve in one county in one city is one curve too many so i am passionate about everyone following the guideline because of the outlier curve maybe that wa a better way of putting it the president yeah that ’ s exactly — dr birx the outlier curve — the president i think that ’ s perfect dr birx — in specific county is to make sure that doesn ’ t happen anywhere else so would you feel better if every state did a stayathome order would you feel better dr birx well i think most of the state have done that i think if you — one death from this is one death too many i mean i come out of epidemic and pandemic we know what to do i know we don ’ t have a vaccine and i know we don ’ t have a therapeutic but we know what can be done and others are doing it and most of the people in the united state are doing it it ’ s our community — it ’ s every american that ha to make these change and i know they ’ re really hard and i know it ’ s hard to remember i mean i have to say to myself every day because i ’ m around very important people to like never touch anything and i ’ m just like paranoid now about touching thing i ’ m sure you all are too i mean we ’ ve gotten to the place where we don ’ t go to your place on pebble beach we go to the one that ’ s open aired because i mean you ’ re trying to protect your reporter i mean i understand that we ’ re all trying to protect each other and we all have to adapt to this new reality that we ’ re in right now and i believe everybody is trying really hard and i ’ m just asking them to try really really hard for these next day because they will make a tremendous difference we see that evidence and so it ’ s like having a vaccine or a therapeutic because we know what work and we ’ re asking everybody to apply what work and i know it take amazing attention to detail because you know the minute you forget or do something you ’ re like “ oh my gosh i should have never done that ” and that ’ s the level of attention it take if covering our face could help u do that and guideline are coming out — the president so i just want to say — look many state have started low and slow and then they stayed at a good level some really stayed at a great level some — louisiana a an example it wa low and slow and they were looking great i wa watching it because you know it ’ s kind of a place people go to with mardi gras — which sort of is an interesting point because after mardi gras it wa low and then all of a sudden it went up very rapidly and now it ’ s one of our true hotspot right certain area of michigan — detroit wa — it looked like it wa doing pretty good and then all of a sudden it went up so you have that too but i ’ ll tell you what we have state that have been really incredible in the fact that they have kept so — so low they have not — you haven ’ t seen the bump and i hope you don ’ t i hope you don ’ t and you have a couple that for a lot of different reason — and that ’ s not to blame anybody but they are at a higher level but very few i think deborah — i mean i may say i think most people have actually followed the presidential — you can call them whatever you want i would never use the word “ dictate ” because if i used that word i would be in such trouble in fact you ’ ll put me in trouble just that i even mentioned the thought of it okay but we make a recommendation and i think they ’ ve done a good job and maybe they started a little later but maybe they ’ re also more difficult state but we ’ ve done i think on average really phenomenally a a country i think we ’ ve done phenomenally because when you looked at that graph the other day — i don ’ t know if you saw it i assume you saw it everybody in the world saw it but you look at all those line on the bottom — one color after another all different representing different state — it ’ s all crowded at the bottom and then you had two that were up but you had — i don ’ t know almost every one of them wa down low very low so there were a lot of people listening and i just did — i want to be clear because i don ’ t need headline tomorrow and neither doe the country because i don ’ t want this country working so hard and then have press that is in this case maybe misinterpret something because i might have — i might have — when i heard it i wa surprised at first too but i understood what deborah meant mr president — can you clear something else up again the president but i think it ’ s very important — because i think it ’ s very important for you to be accurate one other thing just a quick thing so what i found is when governor call me — i mean i think in every case they ’ ve always been so nice so nice and i ’ ve seen them and heard them say “ thank you very much you have done a great job ” “ a fantastic job ” in one case “ thank you thank you thank you then i ’ ll see the governor usually of the opposite party in almost all case except maybe one — but in almost all case they ’ re very generous they ’ re very nice they thank me everything is great we ’ re doing a great job and then i ’ ll see them on television and just like a different person and i realized there are some people because of politics that if they say “ we want ventilator ” and i ’ ll say “ no jim i want to give you ventilator they ’ ll say “ thank you you are the greatest president that ’ s ever lived and then i ’ ll see them quoted in a paper or see them on a show and they ’ ll say “ the president didn ’ t come through for me i ’ m very disappointed in the president ” and we have a lot of that they ’ re very happy when they talk to me and then i see them but there are some people if they asked for of something and if i gave them they will say — you ’ ll say “ how ’ s the president doing “ well we don ’ t like the job to my face they ’ re very nice but then sometimes — i guess they assume i don ’ t watch them or something but i watch very closely yeah please mr president one especially vulnerable population is the prison population and that ’ s — especially with jared here i wondered if you could address what the federal government is doing to protect inmate the president well it ’ s vulnerable in that it ’ s close together really i — i can ’ t tell you about age but a lot of young people in prison some people — some state — i have not done that at all but some state are letting people out of prison some people are getting out that are very serious criminal in some state and i don ’ t like that i don ’ t like it but it ’ s a city or state thing in certain case a you know i think maybe philadelphia come to mind so we ’ ll see you have to see what what ’ s going on and we don ’ t like it the people don ’ t like it and we ’ re looking in to see if i have the right to stop it in some case okay mr president million american filed for unemployment last week we haven ’ t heard you talk a lot today about what they ’ re going through so what ’ s — the president oh i think it ’ s — — your message to them and — the president i think they ’ re going through i think it ’ s terrible so look four week ago we had the greatest economy in the history of the world the greatest in the world — greatest in the history of the world we had the most job ever in the history of the united state almost million job right and then one day i get a call from deborah who ’ s fantastic and from dr fauci and he said and she said “ we have a problem i said “ what ’ s the problem and they said “ we may have to close it up i said “ close what up they said “ close up the country and i said “ what ’ s that all about and we discussed today — and probably not since we came to that conclusion — and she is a fantastic person a brilliant person and this is what she know i said “ ha it ever been this bad and i think i can represent that you said “ no and part of it — it ’ s a contagion it ’ s so contagious it ’ s like if you sneeze i probably get it whoever heard of a thing like that okay and this very talented reporter is bailing out okay he ’ s out of here i don ’ t blame you but it ’ s a very contagious thing and — probably the like of which we ’ ve never seen in term of that but — so that ’ s over year ago but that wa — you know it ’ s been written about many many time that wa a horrible — whether it wa or million people — i ’ ve heard from to i ’ ve heard to — but it wa ten of million of people now we have the advantage of communication this could have been just a bad i mean here we can read on the internet we can see what to do we can have these meeting they can watch on television which they do a lot of people are watching a lot of people are watching and they say “ gee social distancing ” but in they didn ’ t have that option you know they didn ’ t know what to do they just noticed people were dying all over the place think of it to million people died a lot of people in this country died i always — to me it ’ s a great — it ’ s a great question how come more people didn ’ t die in this country and they say it actually started in this country and went to europe i mean we lost a lot of people but relatively we lost very few compared to europe so this is a terrible thing that happened and what ’ s happening now with people and job — so think of the position i ’ m in we have built all together everybody — not me everybody — the greatest economy in history and all of a sudden people come in that we respect and we know and here ’ s the thing they were right everybody questioned it for a while not everybody but a good portion questioned it they said “ let ’ s keep it open let ’ s ride it if we did that — you saw the other graph and whether it ’ s true or almost true or maybe not true enough — the number wa million people would have died million people would have died in a short period of time in fact the graph could have been even shorter i always noticed that that horrible one — where it go high — it actually come down a little bit faster it might have been over faster and you would have lost million people so they come in and they say “ we have to close up the country and i say “ you know what that doe to this — to the fabric of this country to people that had great job great family no problem with money their — everything is perfect then all of a sudden they go from that to having no job in one day they never even thought of it and then you see million people unemployed unemployment number get released and you see million people and it ’ s an artificial closing it ’ s not like we have a massive recession or worse it ’ s artificial because we turned it off think of all we ’ re doing we ’ re saying “ don ’ t go to work and we ’ ll pay you everything is the opposite it wa always “ go to work and make a lot of money and do well and — the american dream because of a hidden enemy we ’ re saying “ don ’ t go to work and we ’ re going to pay you ” look at the money trillion and we will probably do more i think infrastructure would be a fantastic thing to do you want to get the restaurant back you give deductibility you understand what that is you give deductibility for business where they go and they use the restaurant the restaurant will be bigger and better than they were before you know people don ’ t know a lot of restaurant closed when they ended deductibility and then they started doing well but they had fewer restaurant but the boom of the restaurant is when they had deductibility where corporation could use them so — and entertainment that wa a great thing but they closed it and then they closed it again and it wasn ’ t the same but if you want to get them back you do that but infrastructure we borrow our money now at zero you know if were paying percent percent percent it ’ s a different ballgame we ’ re borrowing — we can borrow long term for zero — literally zero you know that — because we ’ re considered the safe investment all over the world they want money in the united state that ’ s where they want the money so i know better than anybody i just — i know what they ’ re going through and it ’ s horrible but you know what i want to do i want to be able to get them back fast when this is over it ’ s going to be a day we ’ re going to celebrate because everyone is going to go to work and i think we ’ re going to have boom time i think it ’ s going to be great and we ’ ve learned a lot we ’ ve learned about border we ’ ve learned about reliance on other country we ’ ve learned so much — so much that i think we really have a chance to be bigger and better and stronger and i think it ’ s going to come back very quickly but first we have to defeat this enemy so we will see you tomorrow thank you very much thank you end pm edt</td>\n",

send a letter to its business clients today say that they don ’ t have the necessary guidance from the sba from the treasury department to be able to accept loan applications start tomorrow the need be clearly enormous but at least one major bank say they ’ re not fully empower yet to be able to help their customers secretary mnuchin well as i speak to all the ceos yesterday — i have a conference call with them — we get very good input from them on what they need as i say people be work until o ’ clock i believe we just put up the federal register with the new guidelines for lenders i ’ ve be assure that the bank will be in the process start tomorrow now again it ’ s go to take a little bite of time but we commit that this will be available tomorrow and i encourage all company go to sbacom sbagov go to treasurygov you can see the information you need immediately just to follow up with the smallbusiness owners a number of them be say that they be on that conference call and that there ’ s a tremendous power struggle go on between the treasury and sba and that it ’ s over process and form be what they tell me that lenders be actually opt out because they can ’ t make enough money to even service the loan so how be you go to make sure these smallbusiness owners get the capital they need to survive right now secretary mnuchin well first of all i can assure you — jovita be here jovita use to work for me as the treasurer there be no power struggle administrator carranza no secretary mnuchin jovita and our team as i say work together until o ’ clock in the morning and start work at o ’ clock again we ’ ve make the form simpler and i can assure you at five point — i ’ ve tell these bankers they should take all their traders and put them in the branch there ’ ll never be another opportunity to earn five point on a government — fully governmentguaranteed loan and those check right into direct deposit the irs now say it would take four to five months you ’ re say two weeks can you give us a solid — secretary mnuchin well let me be — let me be clear i don ’ t know where you ’ re hear these things i tell you this would be three weeks i ’ m not commit to two weeks we ’ re deliver on our commitments the irs which i oversee within two weeks the first money will be in people ’ s account just to follow up on that i think the question be not about the first check for folks who have direct deposit it sound like those will go out pretty quickly the question be then for folks who don ’ t have direct deposit secretary mnuchin sure and there be a staff memo that be release by the house ways and mean committee today say that that process could take up to five weeks sic that take you to midaugust be that how long it ’ s go to take secretary mnuchin that be not go to take five — or five months i ’ m sorry secretary mnuchin again let me just say when obama send out these check it take months and months and months i be assure the american public they need the money now what we ’ re go to do be — again if we have your information you ’ ll get it in two — in — within two weeks social security you ’ ll get it very quickly after that if we don ’ t have your information you ’ ll have a simple web portal you ’ ll upload it if we don ’ t have that we ’ ll send you check in the mail how many check can you process in a week though how many check can you — secretary mnuchin again we can process a lot of check but we don ’ t want to send check in this environment we don ’ t want people to get check we want to put money directly into their account thank you mr secretary this be for i guess both you and the administrator there have be some anecdotal report that business people be try to get access to the online site to submit the applications the website have be crash i ’ ve hear of webinars go offline because there ’ s just too many people on them so how be you guy go to be ready you know tomorrow to get these loan out secretary mnuchin we ’ ve bring in a lot of external resources at sba and us to make sure there ’ s additional capacity as i say we hear a lot of good feedback yesterday to simplify this process it ’ s go to be up and run now let me just be clear that doesn ’ t mean everybody be go to get their loan tomorrow but the system will be up and run we encourage people over the next week sign up you can go on right now you can go on the web see what information you need very simple process mr secretary on a separate subject have you be in touch with leader mcconnell and speaker pelosi about their differences right now about another stimulus package secretary mnuchin i speak to — i ’ ve speak to the leader i ’ ve speak to the speaker i ’ ve speak to the president constantly when the president be ready and think we should do the next stage we ’ re ready the president have talk about the issue of infrastructure since the campaign i think you know that ’ s a big priority for him and again if we run out of money on the smallbusiness program we ’ ll be back right away to congress to get this increase do the unemployment number today increase the urgency of do a phase four secretary mnuchin well let me just say you know we ’ re go through something that we ’ ve never do before where the government have shut down big part of the economy because of health reason our economy be in great shape our company be in great shape there be three ways that americans be go to be protect for small business they ’ ll get pay by their business through this program the direct deposit there ’ s also enhance unemployment so we realize unfortunately there be a lot of company that because they aren ’ t in business over a short period of time — again we ’ re work with the state on enhance unemployment and as soon as the medical professionals and the president give the all clear we ’ re go to have a ton of liquidity we have about trillion — this have never be do between us and the feed — to put into the economy to support american workers and american business mr secretary in addition to the jobless number we saw today phase three be sign before the social distance guidelines be extend for another month so what additional relief be you go to give to americans as they stay out of work for all these extra weeks i mean what be you wait for secretary mnuchin well we — in design this program we think that we have liquidity for about weeks and that ’ s what we ’ ve design and again i think the president ’ s be very clear if we need to go back to congress to support the american economy and american workers we will be do that secretary mnuchin house speaker nancy pelosi have form a select committee to oversee the distribution of recovery fund and she say she want to make sure that those fund be wisely and efficiently spend do you think that select committee be something that ’ s necessary secretary mnuchin i don ’ t i mean you know the — both party want us to have oversight want us to have transparency we have full transparency we have a oversight committee that the speaker get to pick someone the leader get to pick someone i believe there ’ s five people on it and again that committee will review the money that we ’ re spend and again we support full transparency taxpayers should understand how we ’ re go to support this economy and job mr secretary senator murkowski have ask you to consider provide loan to energy company under the care act the phase three bill what be your thoughts on that would you consider provide those loan to energy company secretary mnuchin so thank you and let me clarify i have very limit ability to do direct loan out of the treasury i can do them for passenger airlines cargo airlines contractors and national security company outside of that we work with the federal reserve to create broadbased lend facilities which we will do so so our expectation be the energy company like all our other company will be able to participate in broadbased facilities whether it ’ s the corporate facility or whether it ’ s the “ main street ” facility but not direct lend out of the treasury a question for clarity about the direct payments to americans for those folks who don ’ t have bank account who don ’ t have direct deposit information on file with the irs how long would they have to wait for their check secretary mnuchin well for people who don ’ t have direct deposit — again we ’ ll have an easy way they put it up we can on a roll basis — i think you know within a couple of days when they give it to us we ’ ll send the money out we do realize there be people who be underbanked and again we ’ re work with all the digital company prepay debit card we ’ re work with all of them to make sure we have a process that every american get their money quickly this money do people no good if it show up in four months and we will deliver on that promise so “ quickly ” be a matter of weeks then perhaps not months secretary mnuchin “ quickly ” be a matter of weeks and not months that ’ s correct mr secretary would you consider a moratorium — secretary mnuchin in the back go ahead mr secretary one area where you can make direct loan be to the airlines how much do you expect that the treasury department and the federal government will be involve in oversee the operations of airlines as it pertain to which rout get cut back how much they operate what they do about their employees and the like secretary mnuchin so there be — there be very strict requirements that ’ s build into the bill again this be a bipartisan requirement one anything we do with the airlines they have to maintain substantially all of their employees so again any money that we provide them will go to pay their employees we ’ re go to be work with the secretary of transportation there be requirements to maintain certain rout so again we have a very clear process we ’ ve hire three outside advisors who will be financial advisors and three law firm we ’ ll be release that information shortly and i want to thank them they ’ re all work for basically very very little money they couldn ’ t work for free so they ’ ve agree to basically work for what they would sign up to work for charitable organizations so again no big fee to bankers we ’ ve get a great team of three lawyers and three financial advisors that will assist us mr secretary just to follow up on that will you give us a list of the name of those people who be advise you when you release the information secretary mnuchin of course we will we ’ ll give you the name as well as the contract so again — do you have any name right now other than blackrock secretary mnuchin so again i ’ m happy to announce we have — the pjt partner — okay — be go to do the passenger airlines moelis company be go to do the cargo and contractors and perella weinberg will handle the national security and there ’ ll be three law firm which we ’ ll announce shortly that will be work in each one of those sectors and again let me just be clear we need to get this do quickly the airlines need money we ’ re go to work very closely with the department of transportation and get this do quickly we ’ ve actually already receive contract from a lot of the people again there ’ s guidance up on the web full transparency we ’ ve ask for applications mr secretary on the airline issue again you know speaker pelosi and others have say that the government take stake in those airlines should not be a condition for the federal government to provide payroll support specifically what ’ s your response to that secretary mnuchin i speak to the speaker last night about that this be something that be highly negotiate between the republicans and the democrats the president be personally involve in this he be on the phone with us many time mitch mcconnell mark meadows senators on both side there be a specific line in the bill that say that the secretary mean me will determine proper compensation so this be not a bailout for the airlines and i will be work — once we get our advice from our financial advisors we get the applications from the airlines i ’ ll be work very closely with the president and we ’ ll make sure that we strike the right balance not a bailout taxpayers get compensate but these airlines — these be national security issue we want to keep our airlines intact mr secretary just more broadly for — perhaps for the administrator if not for you as well some small businesses restaurant owners for example be find that lay off their employees so that they can start collect unemployment be better both for them as business owners and for their workers what incentives do they have right now to keep their employees on the payroll if no one be come into their restaurant secretary mnuchin well the incentive that you have — and we want american business to be keep intact the incentive be these be loan that turn into grant so if you ’ re a business owner and you ’ re a restaurant you can hire your people back you get money for their medical you keep them on the medical plan you get money for your rent you get money for your electricity so you ’ re motivate we want you to have a business that you can reopen quickly when it ’ s appropriate so this doesn ’ t cost the business owners anything you know when people talk about — i can ’ t imagine any american worker who have a job have offer to keep their job isn ’ t go to want to have it and let me just be clear — we ’ ve also talk about this unemployment issue you can only get unemployment if you don ’ t have a job so unemployment be intend for those people that be some of the midsize or larger businesses — and we ’ re very sympathetic to this — that these company can ’ t afford and for those people the enhance unemployment will be a significant benefit but we want to make sure — percent of the american workforce be small businesses under people the president the vice president the administrator and i want to make sure this part of the economy be ready and intact when we ’ re ready to reopen a question for the administrator if i may be there a certain category of small businesses that you ’ re most concern about restaurants hair salons things like that administrator carranza that ’ s a great question we ’ re concern about every small business there ’ s million small businesses that we ’ re really focus on and we ’ re work feverishly to make sure that we can provide the available fund to them as quickly as possible so it ’ s million small businesses and the other businesses be be deal with with the ppp with the paycheck protection there be also the disaster — what we call it the injury — or economic injury disaster loan and then there be an advance associate with that particular program as well so to answer your question we ’ re concern about all businesses and as the secretary indicate we ’ re look at employees be ready not lose in this process we want businesses to stay intact because they represent half the — half the gdp so if we spend a trillion to support trillion or trillion i think that ’ s a significant investment and that ’ s what we ’ re focus on be there a certain segment that ’ s particularly vulnerable secretary mnuchin let me — i just want to — hang on i just want to make one comment for explanation because i want to make sure everybody out there understand this if you ’ re an independent contractor if you ’ re a sole proprietor you ’ re eligible for this as well now that program win ’ t be up and run until next week but again this be a very broad definition of small business so if you ’ re an independent plumber if you ’ re an independent contractor you ’ re cover under this program it ’ s slightly more complicate you have to come in to your bank and give them more information but start next week that part of the program will be up and run also charities charities as well very important the vice president and president make sure that we cover small charities in this and do that include church and religious nonprofits secretary mnuchin it do although there be some technical issue but yes it do include faith organizations be that under the under the — that ’ s under the sba program secretary mnuchin this be under the ppp yes the new sba program they be cover the president okay thank you all very much secretary mnuchin okay thank you everybody the president thank you jovita thank you steve great job thank you okay so that begin right away and they start hand out check and a lot of people be go to have their businesses build back up quickly i hope and we ’ ll see it ’ s complicate big small business be actually big business so i thank them both and please — good we have some great gentlemen let me see great gentlemen that ’ s correct thank you very much today my administration be also issue new guidelines to protect elderly americans who remain the most vulnerable by now nurse home should have suspend the entry of all medically unnecessary personnel today we ’ re further recommend that all nurse home facilities assign the same staff to care for the same group of residents consistently to minimize any potential spread and we ’ re also urge facilities to designate separate areas for healthy and sick residents and this be a practice that we probably will be recommend into the future long after the enemy be go — this particular enemy be go we ’ re also make every effort to provide relief to our great veterans we take very good care of our veterans at my direction secretary wilkie will use any authority at his disposal to extend deadlines for benefit and to postpone debt collections we ’ re now conduct well over coronavirus test per day it ’ s over a thou — a hundred thousand test a day –and these be accurate test and they ’ re move rapidly — which be more than any other country in the world both in term of the raw number and also on a per capita basis the most the fda have also authorize the first coronavirus antibody test develop by cellex a key step that will help identify people who have recover and to understand their immune response and their immune system moments ago i direct secretary azar and act secretary wolf to use any and all available authority under the defense production act to ensure that domestic manufacturers have the supply they need to produce ventilators for patients with severe case of covid you know what that be right become a very famous term covid — covid this action will help general electric hillrom medtronic resmed royal philips and vyaire medical overcome obstacles in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilators we have over be build right now or soon to be start we anticipate issue more order under the defense production act in the very near future in addition to the one that i ’ ve just sign against for facemasks — we just sign an element of the act against and hopefully they ’ ll be able to do what they be suppose to do i just speak to mary barra of general motor and she say they ’ re very soon go to be ready to start production of the ventilators they have a lot of ventilators that they ’ ve commit to build and they ’ ll be start very very quickly fema continue to deliver resources to areas most affect by the virus include new york on top of the bed we ’ re already provide to the javits center the department of defense be add another icu bed governor cuomo have ask that this facility go — and it ’ s a big beautiful facility — it be convert to a covid hospital and we hadn ’ t do that yet we hadn ’ t think in term of do that but their use be — their real demand be for that and we have meet on it with the task force we have meet with the military and i ’ ve decide to say “ yes i ’ m go to do that ” that i will be sign and agree to a “ yes ” answer so that — we will be do that and also we will be staff it so the federal government be do a lot of things that wasn ’ t anticipate that it do this be a — andor can easily be set up — hospital build in javits center and so we ’ re go to be convert that to a hospital and it ’ s go to be staff by the military and by the federal government and base on the fact that i agree to that we have two other facilities that be likewise ask for it and that would be in louisiana and also in dallas and we ’ ll be do those we speak to the governor of louisiana speak to the governor of texas and we ’ ve tell them that we will be staff those hospitals again above and beyond but that ’ s okay we have to do that in addition the usns comfort be dock in new york to accept patients that be a noncovid to date fema have deliver more than million mask respirators and it ’ s — think of that million four million don ’ t forget we ’ re a secondary source the state be do it and we ’ re back them up but we ’ ve get million respirators million surgical mask face shield million gloves and ventilators just to the city and to the state of new york and some of them now be be send i speak with both governor cuomo and mayor de blasio a little while ago and some of them be be send to the city all of america stand with the people of new york in this time of need it ’ s definitely a hotspot but we have other hotspots also and we ’ re take them — take care of them very very strongly very powerfully we have the finest people in the world in those locations and i think the federal government have not only act early but act quickly professionally there ’ s no people like this doctor nurse first responders and other healthcare providers who want to help new york at this critical time should visit website nycgovhelpnow nycgovhelpnow they need help now they need people to help them we have great facilities and we ’ ve build some brandnew facilities big ones but we need help we need help for professional people so if you ’ re in an area that isn ’ t so affect and you ’ re a doctor a nurse a healthcare worker please get to that website and we would really appreciate your help new york city need it louisiana by the way need it michigan need it whatever you can do those be very strong hotspots they need help in recent weeks as the virus have spread and economic hardship have follow we have see americans unite with incredible selflessness and compassion i want to remind everyone here in our nation ’ s capital especially in congress that this be not the time for politics endless partisan investigations here we go again have already do extraordinary damage to our country in recent years you see what happen it ’ s witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt and in the end the people do the witch hunt have be lose and they ’ ve be lose by a lot and it ’ s not any time for witch hunt it ’ s time to get this enemy defeat conduct these partisan investigations in the middle of a pandemic be a really big waste of vital resources time attention and we want to fight for american live not waste time and build up my poll number because that ’ s all they ’ re do because everyone know it ’ s ridiculous so we want to focus on the people of this country even the people of the world — we ’ re go to be able to help them — because right now as an example we ’ re build so many ventilators — very very hard to build — but we ’ re build thousands thousands of them and a lot of them will be come at a time when we win ’ t need them as badly because it take time very complex very expensive and we ’ ll be able to help outside of our country we think we ’ ll be able to help that ’ s something that you can not easily produce as citizens we ’ re link together by the share bond of national love loyalty and affection there ’ s no earthly force more powerful than the patriotic pride that stir in our hearts and that be so true it ’ s incredible the job that everybody have be do everybody they don ’ t sleep they don ’ t go to bed sometimes they get nothing i say to somebody recently on the task force “ how many hours ’ sleep have you get over the last couple of days the answer be “ none none in one massachusetts neighborhood citizens come out of their home each night at o ’ clock from their porches and

and also the president take the unprecedented step to direct the department of defense to use military healthcare personnel to operate all covid facilities at the javits center in new york at the convention center in new orleans and at the convention center in dallas and we inform each of the governors of those state today that at their request we be make those military medical personnel available to operate in an allcovid facility but we would emphasize to people in that community who believe you ’ ve be impact or have contract the coronavirus contact your local healthcare provider we anticipate in the new york area that your local healthcare provider will make the decision whether you be transfer to the javits center and in all case simply look to the guidance of your local governors about how best to receive the care that every american — every american be entitle to have beyond that let me say that we have be work through fema ’ s acquisition process not only to deploy but to gather up personal protective equipment and in just a few moments you will hear from admiral john polowczyk about the extraordinary progress that we have make in deploy not just the strategic national stockpile but also in identify on the commercial marketplace around america and around the world literally millions of mask surgical gown gloves protective equipment and at this point we ’ ve

with dozens and dozens of people at the fema stabilization task force to make sure that we be leave no stone unturned to find the supply we need let me also say today you ’ re go to hear from jar kushner senior advisor to the president of the unite state but someone that the white house coronavirus task force direct to work with fema on supply chain issue and in recent weeks he ’ s be lead a work group in conjunction with fema that literally have identify millions of medical supply around the nation and around the world and we ’ re grateful for his efforts and his leadership finally you ’

patient have the treatment that they deserve every healthcare provider every doctor and nurse and nurse ’ s assistant have the protective gear to provide the care that you would want your family to have by put into practice the president ’ s “ days to slow the spread ” i mean we want you to take to heart the president ’ s coronavirus guidelines for america first to protect your own health to protect the health of your family to protect the health of your community we know so many people be asymptomatic and people that literally don ’ t know they have the coronavirus but have the ability to infect others we want you to put these guidelines into practice social distance use a drivethrough at a restaurant wash your hand on a regular basis but as we focus today on supply make no mistake about it every american can make sure that our healthcare workers and more importantly americans that be struggle with coronavirus have the equipment to support their treatment by put these principles into practice because the fewer americans that contract the coronavirus the fewer americans will have to enter our healthcare system and that ’ ll continue to preserve the capacity in our healthcare economy so we thank the millions of americans who have respond in the first two days of “ days to slow the spread and i ’ m just absolutely confident that in the days ahead every american be go to do their part — for your health your family ’ s health the health of your community — and to ensure the strength and vitality of the greatest healthcare system in the world with that let me introduce jar kushner to speak about the work that he ’ s be do work with fema on ensure a strong supply chain to meet this moment jar mr kushner thank you mr vice president and thank you for your great leadership on the task force and thank you to dr birx and dr fauci as well it ’ s be an honor work with you these past few weeks when the vice president first ask me to help on the task force with different task i ask the president what he expect from the task force and how i can best serve him and the task force what the president ask be that all of the recommendations that we make be base on data he want us to be very rigorous to make sure that we be study the data collect data a lot of things in this country be happen very quickly and we want to make sure that we be try to keep update our model and make sure that we be make inform decisions and inform recommendations to him base on the data that we be able to collect and put together the president want to make sure that we have the people do the best job and make sure that we have the right people focus on all the things that need to happen to make sure that we can deliver in these unusual time for the american people the president also instruct me to make sure that i break down every barrier need to make sure that the team can succeed this be an effort where the government be do things that the government doesn ’ t normally do where we be stretch we ’ re act very quickly and the president want to make sure that the white house be fully behind the different people run the different line of effort to make sure that we get everything do in a speed that the president demand the president also want us to make sure we think outside the box make sure we ’ re find all the best thinkers in the country make sure we ’ re get all the best ideas and that we ’ re do everything possible to make sure that we can keep americans safe and make sure we bring a quick end to this in the best way possible and balance all the different aspects that need to be think of while we do this this truly be a historic challenge we have not see something like this in a very very long time but i be very confident that by bring innovative solutions to these hard problems we will make progress today we be brief the president earlier he ask me to come out and talk a little bite about what we ’ ve do on the supply chain task force which admiral polowczyk have be lead and what he ’ s be very impress by be the way that we ’ ve be resourceful to find product all over the world all over the country and we be find ways to solve the different problems the president have be very very hand on in this he ’ s really instruct us to leave no stone unturned just this morning — very early this morning — i get a call from the president he tell me he be hear from friends of his in new york that the new york public hospital system be run low on critical supply he instruct me this morning i call dr katz who run the system ask him which supply be the most supply he be nervous about he tell me it be the mask i ask what his daily burn be and i basically get that number call up admiral polowczyk make sure we have the inventory we go to the president today and earlier today the president call mayor de blasio to inform him that we be go to send a month of supply to the new york public hospital system to make sure that the workers on the frontline can rest assure that they have the mask that they need to get through the next month we ’ ll be do similar things with all the different public hospitals that be in the hotspot zone and make sure that we ’ re constantly in communications with the local communities one thing i will say just base on data be that we ’ ve be get a lot of data from different governors and from different mayors and from different cities one thing i ’ ve see fema do very very well over the last week or so be now we ’ re get realtime data from a lot of cities people who have request for different products and supply a lot of them be do it base on projections which be not the realistic projections the projections change every day as we see the case as we see the impact of the “ stop the spread ” effort that this task force recommend and the president have be push forward so i do think that we ’ ll see that hopefully there ’ ll be impact of that and the task force have be work very hard through the fema group with admiral polowczyk to make sure that we ’ re get the supply to people before they run out and make sure that we ’ re do it in a proper way i ’ d like to just introduce admiral polowczyk who before come to this — i guess still be — he ’ s the vice director for logistics for the joint staff i get a call from one of the senators say “ well why don ’ t you put a great military person in charge of the logistics and the supply chain and the defense production act and i say “ well the president already do that this be the best man that we have in the country for supply and logistics he join the task force days ago over at fema and he ’ s build a team — really at the direction of the vice president — that include people from fema omb the fda hhs the white house and from everywhere else and what they ’ ve don over the last days have be really extraordinary we ’ ve do things that the government have never do before quicker than they ’ ve ever do it before and what we ’ re see now be we find a lot of supply in the country we ’ ve be distribute them where we anticipate there will be need and also try to make sure that we ’ re hit place where there be need so i can tell you the people on the — in the task force they ’ re work day and night you ’ ve get a lot of people in the government we recognize the challenge that america face right now we know what a lot of the people on the frontlines be face the fear that they have that they win ’ t have the supply they need and our goal be to work as hard as we can to make sure that we don ’ t let them down so i just want to thank everybody and with that i want to introduce admiral polowczyk who ’ s do an amaze job rear admiral polowczyk thank you mr kushner mr vice president so today i ’ m go to cover a couple items — a couple of — five things the first thing i ’ m go to talk about be resources push out from the federal government and then i ’ m go to talk about this air bridge which you may have hear about i ’ m go to talk about data as you say we ’ re — mr kushner be absolutely right we ’ re try to be data drive and with that i ’ m go to talk a little bite about how we ’ re try to expand the industrial base here to meet this challenge so the first thing i want to talk about be surgical mask so we ’ ve all — we ’ ve quickly state number here so these — i ’ m about to go through several different slide to give you just scale and magnitude of federal resources that have be apply at the problem so million surgical mask push out to state governments for mask million mask and so if i be — if i be in a local hospital that be run short i would — i would look upward because the federal government have push out resources so for protective gloves million million pair of protective gloves for face shield million face shield for ventilators we have push to the state more than ventilators and i think as i be come over here that number have change slightly i think it ’ s now give to these state — to the predominantly of these state so we want you to have some number now as we ’ ve indicate we have ventilators in the national stockpile we push ventilators out we ’ re hold ventilators to put to the point of need but we ’ re also buy ventilators ask the industrial base who produce approximately — prior to covid approximately ventilators a year we be go to over the next several months by the end of june work to acquire and so one of the — one of the tool that we ’ re go to — i can anticipate need — we ’ ve already execute — be all of those vendors that we ’ re buy them from will need — potentially will need help in their supply chain with their suppliers we might rate order we might help them get ahead of others in that endeavor so i think mr navarro be go to talk a little bite more on that later so let me talk about the air bridge so it normally take approximately days to get from overseas the product — load it get it to the unite state and distribute it that ’ s about days so to prime the pump so to speak we have line on an air bridge to get product here faster work with our major suppliers as they have — as they work to fill order to get more to healthcare workers now we be work to align transportation to product now one of the things we ’ re also do be the team that work for me be scour the globe and find pocket of personal protective equipment that might not otherwise be in the us hospital supply chain that be also go on these flight six complete and a number schedule twentyeight flight schedule here in the near future we ’ re — we be work towards — some days we ’ ll have one flight some days there might be two flight multiple flight over the next come days these or — as far as i can see out to a couple of weeks then again match product to flight to create volume in the supply chain here faster than the days i ’ m just go to leave that up as i talk about a few other items so let ’ s talk about new york city and the public health hospitals i believe they ’ re call new york city health and hospitals the president direct — as i speak there be pallets be form truck be load i give an address in new york city here an hour or two ago and one of our distributors be make that happen and that delivery will happen tomorrow on the data front this be almost unprecedented this be a commercial supply chain with six to seven major distributors of health equipment we bring them all in and we say we need to make inform decisions and we be go to help make inform allocation decisions so within a matter of days feed from their business systems — their enterprise resourcelike systems — i bring onboard a tool — a supply chain tower — that the dod be use to manage a supply chain for a very complex weapon system their data go into a data lake we have a tool to be able to use their data and see it i can tell what product be come in what their order be what they ’ re fill what they ’ re not fill and see the volume in the supply chain and understand what they ’ re do down to the county level we ’ re work to get it potentially down to the hospital level so this respirators we take a look in there in the supply chain and we say we can ’ t — we have the volume to go do that i call the distributor and they ’ re make — they ’ re make that happen we anticipate as the hotspots around the country — we anticipate these vendors at our direction help them allocate product to the right place at the right time so if i can talk finally about expand the industrial base so the vice president be at walmart the other day who tell him “ i want to get in this game how do i do that so i get the call we provide them specifications and now walmart be go to have — use their suppliers to cut fabric make gown sew product but that ’ s not always the case we have lot of folks that want to help i believe you will see in the come days the use of the defense production act in creative ways to help people that be not do this today to do it we have essentially lead — well the number yesterday be — i believe it probably grow today — that we be work with to find how each one of those might need help to get in the game that ’ s not in the game to increase the throughput through the healthcare market again the president give me one task get more to our healthcare workers now and i take that to heart because i have — not that i don ’ t need that from the president that direction to move out — but i have family in new york my sister be a nurse practitioner in a westchester hospital and my niece be a nurse on a long island hospital and i have other healthcare professionals in the family so i have skin in this game the president ask me to get more to the healthcare workers i ’ m go to get more to healthcare workers i ’ d like to hand it over to mr navarro the vice president inaudible the go out tomorrow — rear admiral polowczyk the be go out as we speak the vice president you might want to be very specific about that rear admiral polowczyk it ’ ll be — it ’ ll be deliver tomorrow can i ask a question the vice president let me — let me be clear on that if i can what jar announce what the admiral just unpack be that pallets be be load right now to send mask — rear admiral polowczyk respirators the vice president — to new york city to the public health hospitals rear admiral polowcyzk to the public health warehouse in new york city the vice president to all the healthcare workers help be on the way base on the tool and the data you have available to you where be the logjam where have it be how have you identify that rear admiral polowcyzk i think — because as you say all this — when we have millions more ppes go out the door as you well know the frontline medical workers be not get it rear admiral polowcyzk so i would answer you — i would answer you this way we put up a lot of number i say that if you ’ re not a — you ’ re in a hospital and you ’ re not see ppe i would look up to the state level first but we aren ’ t — we ’ ve hear from governors sir say they can ’ t get the medical equipment that they need and the reason for that be because accord to governors and also by the fact that we haven ’ t see any number up there about what be go to the private sector can you tell us what percentage of the supply on these large cargo plan be go to private company versus fema versus the state be it percent rear admiral polowcyzk so fema be — so this product that we ’ re move be primarily commercial product that would enter the commercial system and be distribute through financial business transactions between hospitals and these distributors so just to clarify that that explain why state say they ’ re bid like they ’ re on ebay because the supply be go to the private sector and then they have to go there to get the supply rear admiral polowcyzk that ’ s normally how things –that ’ s normally how things work right so i ’ m not here to disrupt a supply chain and say — look these six distributors — six seven — they have six to seven hundred warehouse they have truck to go to the hospital door every day we ’ re bring product in they ’ re fill order for hospitals nurse home like normal i ’ m put volume into that system i would say that we have the data now at last — so we put together this data element over the last you know what thirteen days get the people in look at the problem build this i be now see truth about what ’ s in the supply chain and i would say that there ’ s be some abnormal behavior okay yes thank you admiral house oversight committee democrats say that fema officials tell them that the ventilators that the government have order win ’ t be ready until june which be well after the expect peak will the defense production act memo sign today do anything to speed that up rear admiral polowczyk yes it will mr navarro will talk about that we ’ re on line to receive several thousand ventilators in the month of april and several thousand more ventilators in the month of may ramp up to a big number in june again go from you know an industry that produce about annum — annum to a — to a very big number admiral be you confident that this system mean the state with the greatest need be get the supply rear admiral polowczyk yeah so — because a lot of governors be say that they can ’ t get what they need and different state have more press urgency obviously depend on the caseload rear admiral polowczyk so we marry up — we ’ re marry up where cdc — where the demand for covid be to what ’ s in the commercial system we ’ re provide that to these — to the commercial system and we be make allocations to those of most press need thirteen days — we now have the data we now can make inform decisions and so all of the “ i need i need i need ” i now know the volume that have be happen and need to be happen so admiral with that — and mr president i ’ d love for you to weigh on — the president sure — weigh in on this as well you talk about — well you allude to the fact there be possibly some shady business go on that the product be here in the unite state and — rear admiral polowczyk and come here yes and it be come here it ’ s come from china it ’ s in warehouse it ’ s be make here in the unite state it ’ s in warehouse but it ’ s go to the highest bidder so what can be do to keep those products here in the unite state not go overseas where company be make a lot of money and — rear admiral polowczyk yeah i ’ m go to let mr navarro talk about that — and get it distribute to the most critical place here in the us the president yeah sure peter go ahead i would love to hear — how be that be do because doctor — i ’ ve talk to surgeons — mr navrrro that ’ s great great — great question — on a regular basis mr navrrro let me — let me give you the — the bigger view of the dpa and we ’ ll directly address that what we have essentially be a nation at war we have a wartime president stand behind me the defense production act be one of the most powerful weapons this administration can use to fight the invisible enemy of the virus when i speak with you last week i explain the three point of the compass dpa can be use to hit the first one be mobilization of the industrial base this can involve things like repurposing from say a distiller like pernod ricard — from liquor to hand sanitizer it can also involve expansion of production which be have honeywell — which make mask — open a new factory in smithfield rhode island with respect to the second point in the compass — allocation of resources — we have two issue there if you look at the manufacturer itself what you want to make sure be that the supply chain which can go seventiers deep have enough components in that supply chain so we can actually make what we need and then once it ’ s make you also want to make sure that it go to the right — right people and then the third point of the compass which — which address what you ’ re talk about be basically — “ bust ‘ em ” i call it — hoard of critical or threaten material so let me walk through what — what the president do today in term of a strong action and what we ’ ve do with the dpa across those three point the first order that president trump sign be vigorous swift it be the gm order which direct gm to make ventilators in kokomo indiana in trump time — which be to say “ as fast as possible ” as the president mention he ’ d speak to mary barra today the ceo of gm that be move forward at the same time as the ford project be move forward in rawsonville michigan and i ’ ve issue a challenge to those two company à la “ ford v ferrari ” — this be ford versus gm let ’ s see who get those ventilators out first now the second point of the compass which these two order address today be this allocation of resource issue the ventilator company themselves express concern that in this rush to build ventilators there would be pressure on that supply chain so what they request that we do and the president do be to use the dpa to give this gentleman here — who ’ s one of the strongest gentlemen in the world in term of apply things — be to give him the ability to prioritize that supply chain for those ventilator manufacturers and he will do things like give them what ’ s call a “ do rat ” in the defense procurement which will allow them to get what they need now the second order which the president sign today have to do with the other part of the equation which be once they make the stuff okay do it go to the right folks and this be a order and to be frank over the last several days we ’ ve have some issue make sure that all of the production that do around the world — enough of it be come back here to the right place so what ’ s go to happen with the sign of that order in trump time be we ’ re go to resolve that issue with probably by tomorrow at close of business because we can ’ t afford to lose days or hours or even minutes in this crisis now the third part of the compass — this third point there — this get to the hoard issue the president stand up here with — he ’ s the commanderinchief but we have a sheriff in town too attorney general barr and he stand up here with attorney general barr and bill barr say “ i ’ m go to go out and bust them and guess what three days ago doj go into a warehouse in jersey grab ppe and the beauty of that — the beauty of that it wasn ’ t only seize but within hours it be turn around and give to healthcare professionals in new york and new jersey that ’ s a beautiful thing that ’ s a beautiful case of use the dpa now what ’ s go to happen tomorrow be the president be go to sign another order which be in the work this be interest there be a black market spring up which you have describe where we ’ re have people bid against each other broker come in they ’ re bid and bid on all this different ppe it ’ s drive the price up and guess what you know where it ’ s go the domestic source here be be export when president trump hear about that he say “ that ’ s not go to happen anymore under my watch so tomorrow we ’ re bring that order and what it ’ s go to do be it ’ s go to empower customs and border protection with the help of people like the post office and express mail consigners like up to basically deal with that issue so we be go to crack down unmercifully and i would say to the hoarders out there and the broker that be try to make money off of the misery of people in this country around the world that ’ s get to stop and if you ’ ve get inventory what you need to do be pick up a phone and not call somebody out in — around the world you call fema and say “ we get some stuff we ’ ll give it to you at a fair price and be do with that because that stuff have absolutely get to stop inaudible mr navarro so that ’ s — that ’ s — hang on hang on so that ’ s — that ’ s what we ’ re go to be look for and when we hear case like this we ’ re go to aggressively issue order after order to crack down on it now before — this be not my role to take a bunch of question but let me tell you one other thing before i leave the podium it ’ s a story which i ’ d love to share with you today because this again illustrate the key principles of this president and this vice president which be to wed the full force of the federal government with the full power of private enterprise and just two days ago we at the white house get an urgent sos from the chief of police of the new york police department and they be in a situation now because of the strain on their resources where personnel such as their homicide detectives be have to go on into house and deal with covid issue without protective gear now the beauty of this president be because of his leadership we be able to solve that problem in two phone call two phone call the first one go to phebe novakovic at the general dynamics “ phebe can you call tom kennedy at raytheon i need you guy to basically scoop up all the tyvek suit you can and find any gloves you can ” this president under his leadership and the voluntary efforts and the pride and patriotism you talk about it earlier that — we have tyvek suit deliver to the new york pd within hours that ’ s — that ’ s a new record in trump time at the same time a second phone call be make the tara engel at pernod ricard and laura lane at up they be on the same phone call and i say “ tara laura we get this issue they need hand sanitizer literally within two hours we have drum gallons of hand sanitizer on a up truck head up to the nypd and it probably arrive today with a promise from pernod that they will continue to supply the nypd throughout the course of this crisis so this be a beautiful thing that america be rally to we be become a stronger more unite nation and i couldn ’ t be more proud of this president this administration these guy up here who be do a heck of a job organize the supply chain and my promise to you be that the president be go to use that dpa to make sure that the american people particularly our healthcare professionals get the ppe the medicine everything we need so let me — let me stop there i don ’ t think it ’ s my place here to field a bunch of question the president no you ’ re do a good job thank you mr navarro thank you mr navarro what ’ s the status of the “ buy american ” executive order the president go ahead go ahead answer — mr navarro sure the president you go ahead mr navarro okay — the president come here come here come mr navarro one of the — one of the things that this crisis have teach us sir be that we be dangerously overdependent on a global supply chain for our medicine like penicillin our medical supply like mask and our medical equipment like ventilators we have — right now as we speak over countries have already impose some form of export restrictions in their country against the rest of the world and what we ’ ve — what we ’ re learn from that be that no matter how many treaties you have no matter how many alliances no matter how many phone call when push come to shove you run the risk as a nation of not have what you need and if there ’ s any vindication of the president ’ s “ buy american secure border and a strong manufacture base ” philosophy strategy and belief it be this crisis — because it underscore everything that we see there so the “ buy american ” order which — which be go through process would do a couple things it would simply say — not during this crisis because we don ’ t want to disrupt anything i want to be really clear about that but go forward after this be over the va dod hhs and this government buy american for essential medicine our medical countermeasures and the medical supply and equipment we need at the same time it will deregulate so we can get the fda and epa to facilitate domestic manufacture and then innovate because the key here — the key here be have advance manufacture on us soil that can leapfrog other countries so we don ’ t have to worry about compete against cheap sweatshop labor lax environmental regulations different tax regimes and the massive subsidies of foreign governments who be actually directly attack our industrial base so be patient with that sir it ’ s — the other priorities we have right now be to dpa and what the task force be do but if we learn anything from this crisis it should be never again never again should we have to depend on the rest of the world for our essential medicine and countermeasures the president and by the way we ’ ve cut them out also to be honest we ’ ve stop order go from certain place and in a couple of place — like we have a big order go to italy on important outfit and some ventilators and it be go to italy they make the order a long time ago and i say “ you get to let it go they have an order and i could have cut it under the act i could have cut it i say “ nope you can ’ t do that you get to let it go you know they have big problems we have an order go to spain and i say “ let it go i could have stop it i say “ let it go we ’ re go to be fine i say “ let it go so it work that way also one other thing as to your question oftentimes — and we ’ ve tell this to the governors — mike we ’ ve be very strong on this — have — if you think there ’ s bid between federal government and state let us know and we ’ ll drop out immediately or you drop out and we lower the price but state be bid against each other the president no no if we ’ re bid against each other i say find out who it be and usually they know everyone know and we ’ re notify and we get notify and we ’ ll either drop out or they ’ ll drop out but we have another problem there be countries out there beyond the state there be countries that have this problem and they ’ re order too it ’ s really a mess now in a little while the hardest thing to get be the ventilators because they ’ re — you know it take a while to build them and we have a lot we have thousands of them be build right now in a little while they ’ ll be worth about five dollars but right now they ’ re very valuable and we ’ re go to have a lot of them be ship and in fact that ’ s why general motor call up before — mary that ’ s why others call up two days ago they call up that they ’ re all in production and they ’ ll start — they ’ re start to arrive in a week and a half but there ’ ll be a time when we ’ re go to build stockpile by the way the state should have be build their stockpile we have almost in our stockpile and we ’ ve be build it and we ’ ve be supply it but the state should be build we ’ re a backup we ’ re not an order clerk we ’ re a backup and we ’ ve do an unbelievable job like for instance who ever hear of a governor call up “ sir can you build us a hospital of room and we build it “ can you build us four medical center we build it “ can you deliver a ship — a hospital ship — with room and we do it and we do it in los angeles too we ’ ve be an unbelievable — we ’ ve do an unbelievable job — these people and so — and thousands of people behind them but we ’ re a backup ideally those hospitals would have have all this equipment ideally those state should have have all this equipment and i think they will the next time you know you hear the case where thousands of ventilators could have be have at a very inexpensive price three years ago and a certain state decide not to exercise that right because they want to build a road or they want to build something else because it ’ s big money you ’ re talk about — i think it be a billion dollars but you ’ re talk about a lot of money for something that may never happen because normally on a ventilator — other than a pandemic or an epidemic — you wouldn ’ t — you wouldn ’ t need anything like this hospitals have three ventilators — big hospitals — and they get by with it and now they want thousands i mean they want thousands of ventilators you call up a governor and he ’ ll say “ sir could you send us ventilators nobody have ever hear of a thing like this so they ’ ve do some job let me just tell you when secretary mnuchin speak they want you to call not “ com ” but sbagov — okay — for the application and for information okay so it ’ s sba — small business — sbagov okay if you don ’ t mind yeah let ’ s go please thank you sir thank you mr president i want to follow up from a question yesterday regard i think your administration ’ s denial of the expansion of obamacare special enrollment period in the wake of this pandemic in your own word — vp pence give a fiveminute nonanswer — but people face this pandemic — illness and even worse — most experts say that have healthcare be critical to our nation ’ s health and financial wellbeing the president right can you assure americans tonight that you will reopen obamacare marketplace so that they can be cover in this time of combine health — the president well we ’ re — we ’ re do better than that — and financial crisis the president yeah no i understand the question and we ’ re do better than that we ’ re go to try and get a cash payment to the people and we ’ re work out the mechanics of that with legislature so we ’ re go to try and get them a cash payment because just open it up doesn ’ t help as much so we ’ re go to work it out so we ’ re go to try and get for that certain group of people — it ’ s a certain group of people — a cash payment go ahead i really want to ask you about mask but i also just want to follow up on a couple of hang thread there on just the question earlier about the bid what happen though when state be bid against each other on those market the president well they have that and they have to work that out what they should do be they should have — long before this pandemic arrive they should have be on the open market just buy there be no competition you could have make a great price the state have to stock up it ’ s like one of those things they wait they didn ’ t want to spend the money because they think this would never happen and their shelve in some case be bare and by the way in some case they weren ’ t they be beautifully service they do a good job but in some case their shelve be bare so the best thing they can do be when time become normalize — and they will hopefully soon — and actually you ’ re go to have a lot of excess material because so much be be do right now in term of protective gear protective outfit a lot be be do it ’ s go to be — within six months it ’ s go to be sell for the right price they get to stack up for the next time but we be do that and the admiral have do a fantastic job senator schumer write a letter today and he say “ you should put a military man in charge i say “ well chuck if you know a little bite more we have one of the most highly respect people in the military the admiral this be what he do too very professionally and he ’ s in charge but chuck didn ’ t know that okay jeff please mr president you tweet this morning about your call with saudi arabia ’ s mbs the president yeah we ’ ve have some people say that the figure that you cite — between million and million barrel per day — be not what they ’ re agree to can you be more specific about what exactly they tell us the president i don ’ t know what they ’ re agree to i think they might agree to more than that look russia — russia — do he tell you that sir the president yeah he do say that actually russia talk about million barrel russia and saudi arabia be fight over this and as everybody know it ’ s you know really kill an industry hurt russia badly hurt saudi arabia badly i say “ this be an easy one it should be an easy one and it may be and it may be more than that i be actually tell it may be as i tell somebody before it may be and it may be more than that maybe it ’ s maybe it go up to could be as high as and you know there ’ s a tremendous oversupply right now that industry be — it be oversupplied before the virus and when the virus come along they lose percent of the world and there ’ s an unbelievable — you can ’ t get a ship now every ship be load to the gills sit out someplace in the ocean they ’ re storage tank they ’ re not even ship they ’ re storage tank so it would be great for russia it would be great for saudi arabia i hope they make that deal but that ’ s what they tell me they say — inaudible million be — the president — they say it ’ s — — enough to address the oversupply issue the president well i think it will be hopefully soon i think hopefully they ’ ll announce something soon now can a deal be break can something happen where it doesn ’ t happen i guess in which case there ’ s another alternative but i ’ d rather not see that other alternative i hope they can make a deal what do you mean when you say the “ alternative ” the president they both want — i think they both want to make a deal and they ’ re both smart they love their countries they want to make a deal it ’ s good but it ’ s also good for the world if they do because you save an industry mr president — the president yeah please go ahead go ahead in the back please what do you by “ cash payments ” the president i ’ m go to let mike because we go over this very specifically and i ’ ll let you talk about it mike because you respond last time the vice president right thank you mr president as i say yesterday the president have put a priority on ensure that no american have to worry about the cost of coronavirus test and we ’ ve be work every day to make sure that americans don ’ t have to worry about the cost of treatment and at this point the white house coronavirus task force be work on a proposal for the president to use some of the billion that we ’ re make available to hospitals to compensate the hospitals directly for any coronavirus treatment that they provide to uninsured americans we ’ re work out the detail of that the president will make a final decision tomorrow we expect an announcement but the president have make it very clear we don ’ t want american to worry about the cost of get a test or the cost of get treatment and we ’ ve expand coverage through medicaid we ’ ve expand coverage through medicare health insurance company around the country include blue cross just today announce that all of their members will be waive all copayments on coronavirus treatment but for those some million uninsured americans the president have direct the coronavirus task force to find a way to make sure that they know we will find a way to pay for your coronavirus treatment and the president will be address that and announce that tomorrow mr president — the president go ahead — a point of clarification and then a followup question yesterday you say that you speak to florida governor ron desantis before he issue his stayathome order do you advise him to issue that order the president no but i talk to him about it and he want to do what ’ s right for the people of florida he ’ s be a great governor you could see that just by his popularity which be extraordinary we ’ re proud of him he ’ s do a fantastic job and he make the decision but we speak before he make the decision yes and he have also say that he be consider put people who be suspect of have coronavirus or who have test for positive for it in isolation center and that he would potentially use — the president that i haven ’ t hear no that i haven ’ t hear so he hasn ’ t consult with you the president i haven ’ t hear that yes please thank you mr president ebony bowden from the new york post a few hours ago mayor de blasio the mayor of new york say that new yorkers leave their home should wear mask they should also wear mask when they ’ re with other people be you consider that kind of recommendation on a federal level and if you be how would you prevent a rush on mask the president well i think they ’ re go to be come out with regulations on that and if people want to abide by them frankly i don ’ t think you — i don ’ t think there ’ ll be mandatory because some people don ’ t want to do that but if people want — as an example on the mask if people want to wear them they can if people want to use scarves which they have — many people have them — they can in many case the scarf be better it ’ s thicker i mean you can — if you — depend on the material it ’ s thicker but they can do that if they want now a recommendation be come out we ’ ll see what that recommendation be but — be that a cdc recommendation sir the president but i will say this they can pretty much decide for themselves right now would that be nationwide and can i also just ask– the president nationwide nationwide — the president yeah — not just for hotspots and then i think this be best for dr birx but we ’ ve hear some differ guidance here the who and even the surgeon general have talk about various study that show that mask in addition to maybe not even be helpful to protect people may actually increase the rat of illness because people touch the mask then they touch themselves the president sure can you talk a little bite about just the evolution of — the president all right maybe i will ask — — your think on this the president — dr birx and you might mention that other point also yeah thank dr birx no no thank you so i hope you get from the conference today that we ’ re triangulate data that we know from the case number the test number the supplychain number to create an integrate picture so that we can really support hospitals in their need and i think that level of granularity be really critical secondly i just want to make the point that we really applaud the governors that be look at a wholeofstate or a wholeofmetro approach and what do i mean by that the unite state go into this have about ventilators across the unite state and another to anesthesia machine that ’ s about five time what most of the european countries have but it ’ s a matter of distribution to need and i really applaud the governors that be bring together their public hospitals with their more private hospitals and their visibility across their state because what we try to talk about yesterday be every state every county be different and that ’ s why we ’ re look at it at that level of granularity and as we move through this epidemic the need need to be very tailor to those counties and frankly those hospitals i mean there ’ s a reason why the president and mr kushner have be very much involve in find out what the public hospitals need why be that because the public hospital sometimes have the weakest supply chain because they ’ re often sometimes not as attractive to private sector distributors or they may be too busy care for the need of patients to be really on top of their order form and their supply chain so really listen to the community that ’ s at the front of this fight and get feedback from those specific communities no matter where they be and listen to the frontline healthcare workers because it ’ s their reality that be important to all of us whether you ’ re the mayor or the governor or the federal government and if they ’ re say they need something we have to work together to supply that and so that ’ s what you ’ re see with this triangulation every county will move through this differently and that allow us to move around these vital issue that protect the frontline healthcare workers and protect the patients through the ventilators to make sure that the supply chain be align with the need as it happen now you have to have very good data in order to be will to work in that level of granularity and that ’ s what we ’ ve be work on to really develop that level of granularity to ensure that so i just want to say one other thing about test just to give you the bottomline data of what we ’ re see we appreciate the group who be report not everyone be report yet and this be part of us try to understand at a very granular level we do have two state that do have percent positives and that ’ s new york and new jersey so that confirm very clearly that that ’ s a very clear and important hot zone louisiana though have percent of their test be positive michigan connecticut indiana georgia illinois — so that should tell you where the next hotspots be come — be at percent test positive and then colorado dc rhode island and massachusetts be at percent there ’ s a significant number of state still under percent everyone that i didn ’ t discuss california and washington remain steady at an percent rate so what we ’ re see finally be test improve — more test be do still a high level of negative — in state without hotspots allow them to do more of the surveillance and containment and then prioritize this new rapid test kit to those areas that may not have the same amount of access — to the indian health service and to the public health institutions and the public health and state labs so that they can use that and start forward lean into surveillance now we know there be people wait for test and they ’ re wait for test because when these areas become very — when they get onto the logarithmic curve we prioritize people whose decisions — where the test decision would make it critical for their care and so we prioritize hospitals and we prioritize nurse and doctor and frontline workers the president good dr birx so that mean if you go through a drivethrough or you go through your doctor you could have that delay so the mask so what i try to give you be how we ’ re use data in a very granular way and so there be — there be experiential data when you look at communities that have oftentimes utilize mask — in general for personal protection — from when they particularly be themselves sick and have use their mask in public and we ’ ve look at the rate of this in those populations and then we ’ re look at the scientific evidence to bring those two piece together let me just say one thing though the most important thing be the social distance and wash your hand and we don ’ t want people to get an artificial sense of protection because they ’ re behind a mask because if they ’ re touch things — remember your eye be not in the mask so if you ’ re touch things and then touch your eye you ’ re expose yourself in the same way so we don ’ t want people to feel like “ oh i ’ m wear a mask i ’ m protect and i ’ m protect others you may be protect others but don ’ t get a false sense of security that that mask be protect you exclusively from get infect because there be other ways that you can get infect because of the number of asymptomatic and mild case that be out there and so this worry us and that ’ s why the debate be continue about the mask because we don ’ t want — when we ’ re try to send a signal that every single person in this country need to stay six feet away from everybody that need to be wash their hand constantly and know where their hand be — to send a signal that we think a mask be equivalent to those piece so in the — when the advisory come out it will be an additive piece if it come out rather than say “ this be a substitute for… and we want to make sure everybody understand it be not a substitute for the presidential guidelines that have already go out and to be absolutely clear about that dr birx can i ask a follow up about the test please the president go ahead dr birx there ’ s a lot of evidence we ’ re see — that the experts be say that a high number of these test could be produce false — false negative so — dr birx of the roche and abbott test that as many as one in three test might be provide false negative and i be wonder — maybe you could explain or — dr birx that would be almost be impossible with — — tell a little about the science dr birx — have percent positives you — if that be true you would have percent positive — be you concern about the underlie data — dr birx — or percent positive so what i can tell you be the number of positive test be track very closely with the number of case diagnose so i don ’ t — i will look into that i look at the roche and abbott number every night they ’ re trend exactly in the same way and that ’ s important when you ’ re validate data to really validate “ do this same site ” — in other word i ’ m look between test sit to see be there consistencies be there an anomaly to make sure for what you just very specifically ask so i will go back and look at it more carefully i haven ’ t see that kind of anomaly this be — this same platform be be use across the country and that ’ s a range from what i report percent positivity up to percent positivity and that range reflect also what we ’ re see with the hotspots and the number of case and frankly – i mean we hate to talk about it but it also track with the hospitalizations independent of diagnosis and the mortality that we ’ re see so all of those piece validate together there ’ s no concern that there might – people might be get a false sense of security or that we might not be see all of the data here on – and who have it dr birx well i ’ m tell you i ’ m still miss percent of the data from report i have test report in we ’ ve do million so there be — and it could be those sit so we do need to see all — the bill say you need to report we ’ re still not receive percent of the test dr birx with regard to the test the president ’ s sample collection take one minute result report back in minutes i realize you ’ re the president of the unite state but when will everyone get to take a test that work that quickly and you get result that quickly dr birx so these be new test and we have prioritize the group that we think have the least access to test now and who do we mean by that we mean the indian health service — they ’ re often in remote areas rural areas the governors of the northwestern state that may not have the advantage of these highthroughput machine that be often across the east coast and in high metro areas — colorado — and then across the west coast so we ’ ve prioritize the presidential test to the indian health service and public health labs so that they can support nurse home test and other areas where we think surveillance be absolutely key so at this moment they ’ re prioritize in that way the vice president it ’ s thirteen to twelve hundred dr birx yes of them be go out that way so do more of those test need to be make in order for more people — the president they be be make dr birx yeah okay so in a matter of – the president they ’ re move very quickly — it ’ s happen — in this case dr birx so i ’ m glad you ask that because today there ’ s of these machine already out there we ’ re try to find out exactly where everyone be because you can see that give you amaze flexibility because if people would allow it to be loan to a state that ’ s in a hotspot or a state where you want to do additional surveillance test machine be a huge amount and it really get to your very question about how we can prioritize what we have at the same time we ’ re move out what be new and so really figure out who should those go to how — who can we ask communities — because these will be in the community — to share those machine into the community who need the test now and i think that ’ s really an incredible question that really need to be answer over the next hours dr birx a point of clarity about the facecovering guidance you say it ’ s still a point of debate you say — you use the phrase “ the guidance if it come out be the guidance come out and when the vice president yes yes and — and when sir the vice president in the — in the days ahead we ’ re currently work through the task force take the consultation advice of cdc our top health experts and we ’ ll be bring forward the guidance from the cdc in the next several days dr birx just remember it ’ s not a substitute for everything that we ’ re ask people to do and just to — to everybody out there across the country when we say no gather of we ’ re look at — we want it to be clear if you have a family of we don ’ t want you to be split up but we don ’ t expect people to be have dinner party cocktail party i mean i know you ’ ve see the slope in the unite state versus the slope in italy and we have to change that slope we have to change the logarithmic curve that we ’ re on we see country after country have do that what it mean in the unite state be not everyone be do it so we ’ re only as strong as every community every county every state every american follow the guidelines to a t and i can tell by the curve and as it be today that not every american be follow it and so this be really a call to action we see spain we see italy we see france we see germany when we see others begin to bend their curve we can bend ours but it mean everybody have to take that same responsibility as americans mr president dr birx do that mean — mr president can i have a quick followup on oil please in your conversations with russia and saudi arabia do you have to make any concessions to get them to agree to cut their production the president no like do you agree to cut us production of oil the president no no we didn ’ t discuss that they want to do that that ’ s good for their countries and we do not discuss that now mr president nbc news have learn that the navy be set to fire the captain of the uss theodore roosevelt after he raise red flag about the outbreak on his ship it appear as if he ’ s be punish for try to save the live of the sailors in his command what ’ s your assessment the president oh i don ’ t think so at all but we ’ re go to wait a little while because i understand there ’ s a news conference by the secretary of defense about that but you know i don ’ t — i don ’ t agree with that at all not at all not even a little bite yeah mr president thank you this morning you say once again that new york get off to a late start and they should have push harder but governors and other state leaders say they rely on the federal government to assess the situation and how risky it be and they want to know how would they have know to start sooner without your guidance the president well they have experts and frankly long after we come out and talk about it — look how would i have know to cut off china i cut off china very early and if i didn ’ t we would have a chart that you wouldn ’ t believe so how would i know to do that how would i know to cut off europe i cut off europe very early i mean you have to make a decision people know that some bad things be go on and they get off to a late start and some others get off to a late start also but we cut off china if we didn ’ t cut off china we would have be in some big trouble and we cut it off but do — the president and you know what we cut it off way early go ahead mr president to follow up on the insurance point and a separate question that come in from a colleague who can ’ t be in the room — the president too bad on the insurance point be there go to — the president who be you with who be you with roll call be there go to be an opportunity for insurance company — if in fact hospitals be compensate for uncompensated care – the president right right — be the insurance company go to also get compensate for extraordinary expense that they may have or be they assume that cost the president so we haven ’ t discuss it but we ’ re talk to them you know get them not to pay copays in the case of the big ones be a tremendous thing that ’ s a lot of money they give up but we ’ re discuss that with the insurance company okay the president we ’ ll let you know it ’ ll be pretty quickly yeah go ahead on — i have a question on japan sir they be expand their entry ban to include the unite state be you plan to take any similar action to ban japanese nationals from come to the us as a result of this crisis the president well we ’ re look at a lot of things and a lot of different ban we have more ban than anybody we have ban when ban weren ’ t fashionable if you remember right at the begin of this administration it be for different reason but we ’ ve have ban long before people think of ban when i do china it have never be do before i be the first one to do it remember that it have never — accord to what i read in all the paper this have never be do this be a terrible thing to do and four weeks later they be all say “ we ’ re lucky we do it so we ’ re look at it no we hear that and i think it ’ s fine that they do that they ’ re try to protect their country and we have to protect our country yeah please mr president – mr president i ask you yesterday about stayathome order – the president yeah — and if that you know decision should be leave in the hand of governors or if you ’ re consider tell the entire nation “ stay at home ” the president yeah so just today the — georgia ’ s governor finally issue a stayathome order – the president yeah — say that individuals could have be infect people before they ever felt bad but we didn ’ t know that until the last hours be that ignorance gross incompetence the president he ’ s a good governor brian kemp he ’ s a very good – you ’ ve be have call with these governors the president he ’ s a good governor and he have to make his own decision on that i let the state — i think we ’ re about percent positive on that if you look i think it ’ s about percent of the state have get the stayathome brian be a great governor we ’ ll — it ’ s his decision he make that decision ultimately he decide to go along with it do you think it be smart decision to wait the president and they ’ re do — and they ’ re do well and the state be do well in many respect yeah go ahead please this be another question from a colleague who couldn ’ t make it in today from emily goodin at the daily mail i have a question in regard to the russian plane that land at jfk with medical supply do the unite state ask russia for this aid or be it just accept it the president we ’ re accept it it be a very nice offer from president putin i speak to him the other night as i tell you and they have excess medical equipment things and i ’ ll take it i ’ ll take it he just offer you — the president i think it ’ s very nice we ’ ve have some from china we also help other countries we like do that like i say before if we have excess stuff we let it go out we let some go out where frankly they have order for it and i didn ’ t want to stop order it be a very nice gesture on behalf of president putin and i could ’ ve say “ no thank you ” or i could have say “ thank you and it be a large plane of very highquality medical supply and i say “ i ’ ll take it ” be he offer any further aid in your conversation the president i think he would if we ask for it but he be very nice it be part of the call he suggest — he say “ we have it it ’ s additional they have very big difficulties with this virus also as you know — russia i think it be a very nice gesture on behalf of president putin i could have say “ no i don ’ t want it ” or i could have say “ i ’ ll take it and you know what i say “ i ’ ll take it ” and would you accept further aid the president i think so yeah if they send things that we need i ’ d take it sure nice gesture be there concern about russians use it as propaganda the president i ’ m not concern about russian propaganda not even a little bite he offer a lot of medical highquality stuff that i accept and that may save a lot of live i ’ ll take it every day please in the back mr president you say — in january you tweet that you stand with the people of iran since the begin of your presidency and you ’ ll continue to stand with the people of iran give the fact that they ’ re so hard hit with the coronavirus — the president oh they ’ re very hard hit they ’ re very hard hit but would you consider — the president in a lot of ways they ’ re hard hit they ’ re hit in — with their economy with their military and with obviously the virus they ’ re very hard hit would you consider ease sanction to allow medical supply to get in the president well they haven ’ t even ask us to do that okay but we know that sanction hit the people not the government the president you know what they haven ’ t even ask us to do that but how do a person — the president if they want to meet we ’ d love to meet and we ’ d love to settle the whole thing out but i doubt they ’ ll be — but how do a — realistically how do a person in tehran pick up the phone and call you i mean — the president i think they love america i think the iranians love america i think they ’ d love to be free i think they ’ d love to have just some of the things that we have you know i remember iran many years ago — friends of mine be always in iran they be do real estate deal in iran they be build beautiful build all over iran apartment house it be — they be very successful and then one day that come to an end but you know what the people of iran they remember that it be a long time ago but not so long ago and they remember it and i ’ ll tell you they love america they love what we stand for and we ’ re not look for cha — we ’ re not look for government takeover government change you know this country have be through that many time that doesn ’ t work so inaudible health of the people would you encourage other countries to — who be maybe concern about run afoul — the president well what i do — yeah what i do as you know — — of sanction to — the president — i put it out very publicly with respect to iran i say if they need help with respect to the virus we ’ d love to send — we have the greatest medical professionals in the world we ’ d love to send them over so what countries be you encourage perhaps to — to lend their support because there be many countries that feel — the president i ’ m not encourage or discourage they ’ ve be a very hostile country they make a deal that president obama should have never make it be a shortterm deal give them billion give them billion in cash green fill up this room five time look — but your administration — do you have a moral responsibility to — the president no not at all nobody have even ask me about it i have a moral responsibility to help them if they ask if they — if they need help i would certainly consider different things well the unite nations say they need help the president well that ’ s up to the unite nations i ’ m talk about us and what happen be if they want help — because they have a very big case of virus a very very big case it — one of the worst on earth if you believe what you ’ re read and i happen to believe what i see and what i know and if they want help we ’ d give them help yeah you have one in the back please yes mr president and a question for jar too the — you talk about a granular approach to receive data from these different state and regions to try and figure out what they need the president — you just enact the dpa on ventilators and mask be there be signal from across the country that might indicate there be other things besides mask and ventilators that be slowly kind of rise in term of need — like hand sanitizer for instance the president go ahead mr kushner sure so the first — the first issue that we ’ ve be deal with be really the ventilators that be the number one number two and number three from all the state what we ’ ve be find be that people have a lot of these request base on the model and what we ’ ve be try to do over at fema be say to the state “ well if you would like ventilators we need to see — first look in your state right so for example in northern jersey they ’ re go down to southern jersey and they ’ re find ventilators and try to relocate them to where they have their hotspots the second thing that we ’ ve do ask them to survey for alternative ventilators dr birx speak before about the anesthesia machine and the ability to — to convert them to be ventilators so we ’ re ask people to be resourceful inside their state before they come to the federal government the third thing we ’ ve be ask state to do be to provide what their daily utilization rat be so everyone be ask for everything one congressman get a call from his local hospital say “ i need ventilators and he say “ well you don ’ t have a covid patient within four counties why do you want ventilators and he say “ well we just want to be safe we ’ re very nervous right now ” so what you have all over the country be a lot of people be ask for things that they don ’ t necessarily need at the moment and the job of fema and admiral polowczyk have be to try to make sure that we ’ re get the real data from the cities from the state so that we can make realtime allocation decisions base on the data and right now what ’ s happen be a lot of the different cities and state be provide fema that — that information we ’ re talk to them daily they ’ re update that information daily and that ’ s enable the federal government to make much more inform decisions on where they position ventilators you also have a situation where in some state fema allocate ventilators to the state and you have instance where in cities they ’ re run out but the state still have a stockpile and the notion of the federal stockpile be it ’ s suppose to be our stockpile it ’ s not suppose to be state stockpile that they then use so we ’ re encourage the state to make sure that they ’ re assess the need they ’ re get the data from their local — local situations and then try to fill it with the supply that we ’ ve give them the same thing with the mask so the mask be actually an item that wasn ’ t use as frequently in the medical profession before this it be use mostly for diseases so speak to a lot of the doctor and hospital administrators they would say they use actually a very low percentage of the mask what the president and the vice president be able to do with congress be to get the waiver so that you could expand the pool because a lot of the mask be use to — for the construction industries now there ’ s a much bigger pool of mask in the country there be a stockpile they distribute that base on where they anticipate a lot of the need would go but a lot of that still be stick with the state and it hasn ’ t trickle down to the right place within the state so i would just encourage you when you have governors say that the federal government haven ’ t — hasn ’ t give them what they need i would just urge you to ask them “ well have you look within your state to make sure that you haven ’ t be able to find the resources ” unlike other countries a lot of the medical system in america be a private — it ’ s not a — it ’ s not a public governmentcontrolled so you have to get the data from what ’ s in their state look at it in that way and then make sure that they ’ re be resourceful in a way to do that and also ask them what their utilization percentage be because if one governor be ask for more ventilators and if the federal government send them more than they need the goal here be not to have ventilators sit in a warehouse where you have another state or you have people who need them so what we ’ re try to do be make inform datadriven decisions both on ventilators mask any other supply we can get to make sure it ’ s go to the people who need them i wonder if you could weigh in on the report of which i ’ m sure you ’ re aware where unnamed white house officials have describe your role as be something of run a shadow task force how do you describe your role how do you describe the qualifications you bring to your role mr kushner yeah i would just say very simply — look the president ask the vice president to run the task force the vice president ask me to assist i ’ ve be serve really at the direction of vice president and he ’ s ask me to get involve in different project the vice president and i speak probably sometimes time a day but everything that i ’ m do be at the direction of the vice president if some people be talk to you that mean they ’ re probably not inform as to what ’ s go on but i can assure you that i ’ m speak with dr birx dr fauci the vice president and the president multiple time a day to make sure that i ’ m accomplish and focus on the objectives that the vice president deem a priority jar a followup on the ventilators — the president or they don ’ t exist — and the national stockpile the president or the source don ’ t exist they ’ re fake persons okay a lot of fake source out there they don ’ t exist i read about it — for a long time i ’ ve be read a lot of them — fake source they don ’ t exist go ahead please thank you mr president jar what trigger send a ventilator from the national stockpile to a state in other word how sick do somebody have to be to get one of these national ventilators mr kushner well that ’ s not the issue that we ’ re — that ’ s not the criteria you have the state basically put in the request and they ’ re give us their utilization — their utilization percentages so it ’ s a very simple formula the state should know how many ventilators they have in their state and by the way some governors you speak to or senators they don ’ t know what ’ s in their state you know some governors i ’ ll speak to and they ’ ll know to the number how many ventilators they have in their state because that ’ s the first thing a good manager will do what a lot of the voters be see now be that when you elect somebody to be a mayor or a governor or a president you ’ re try to think about who will be a competent manager during the time of crisis this be a time of crisis and you ’ re see certain people be better managers than others so what i would say be that the way that the federal government be try to allocate be they ’ re try to make sure a you have your data right don ’ t ask us for things when you know that — when you don ’ t know what you have in your own state just because you ’ re scar you ask your medical professionals and they don ’ t know you have to take inventory of what you have in your own state and then you have to be able to show that there ’ s a real need and so we prepositioned a lot of things because most governors off the bat didn ’ t know what they need but fema have a joint command with admiral polowczyk admiral giroir and pete gaynor where every couple hours when their request come in they evaluate the request they all vote on the request and then if there be something that they want to elevate to the taskforce they bring it to the vice president to make a recommendation the vice president and jar if i may you might ask deborah to — we ’ re literally track hospitalization case on a daily basis interact with governors and health systems and that inform our supply chain decisions dr birx yeah i really — i want to thank the health commissioners and all of them that have be send hospital data and i think it ’ s really critical and important to all of us new york city have be provide information new jersey connecticut rhode island and certainly louisiana in these hotspots and that allow us — we can see where they be with the rise number of case where they be in their curve what can be predict and really ensure that people get what they need as they need it and so i think many of the governors now and the health commissioners have be “ i have to use ” — “ i ’ m intubate people a day now i have enough for th next three days if that doubles…we ’ re see our hospitalization rat stabilize but we still think there will be this many more in the next days that ’ s the information that they then translate into provide the ventilators so when you see the ventilator number go out they ’ re go out in and because i think early on we send a big bolus out and then not all of them even today have be fully utilize and so we want to make sure every state and every hotspot can be reassure that ventilators be there for them as they move through the curve and i think to date we ’ ve be able to do that and i think that ’ s what ’ s important to me be that people have what they need when they need it and to date people who have need ventilators have be able to get on ventilators and i think that ’ s our goal with governors and with the mayor to make sure that that continue to happen but that mean all of us have to work together and i think that ’ s what ’ s be really important over the last few weeks be people be not make generic request anymore they ’ re make datadriven request because they know precisely what ’ s happen in their hospitals dr birx when you be up here a little bite ago you talk about the curve and what you ’ re see and you ’ re concern that people be not abide by the social distance guidelines i mean you seem in your voice to be quite concern about that have the curve change enough at this point where that to people be likely to die have that shift upwards at all dr birx no it ’ s just when i look at what — so we ’ re in week in our guidelines and i guess what i expect when the president put out guidelines that say “ don ’ t go to bar don ’ t be in group more than people ” when we say that now over days ago that be serious and then you could see what happen subsequently and you can see the number of individuals have be infect since then because the people we ’ re see infect today and in hospitals today be infect after the guidelines go out so that ’ s what we ’ re worry about and we ’ re worry about that we ’ re not — we ’ re still in this and that ’ s why the president extend it for days but we have to get out of this we have to start see this the president but deborah aren ’ t you refer to just a few state because many of those state be dead flat i mean so — dr birx yes the president so it ’ s hard to get — it ’ s hard to be — dr birx yes there be state that be dead flat but you know every — what change the curve be a new detroit a new chicago a new new orleans a new colorado those change the curve because it all of a sudden spike with the number of new case because you have a certain projection of new case and then a whole other city come on top where they ’ re in their logarithmic phase so those ones that i talk about that have test result greater than percent positive all of those — all of those state or all of those counties be in logarithmic phase that mean there be a lot of counties that aren ’ t and we be really — we ’ re excite about those counties that have be test and still find quite flat and hopefully maybe sunday or so or sometime this weekend we can go through all the state and the curve again so you can see where you know that california and washington be still steady but we ’ re watch very carefully because we see that you can go from this to this very quickly and what — this should not be happen any longer in new place if people be do the social distance wash their hand not get together in large group more than the president again so i look at the graph all the time dr birx yes you do the president and you have many many — dr birx yes the president — flatliners i call them “ flatliners i ’ m amaze at them and you have a couple that be up it ’ s hard to blame the flatliners for not do a good job dr birx no no i don ’ t want to say that no i don ’ t — no thank you sir i don ’ t want — in fact i want to praise the state that — and i think i want to be able to call them out and show you their graph so you can see they ’ ve have steady small case they ’ re test and they ’ re do a lot of test and their percent of testpositives be under percent i mean we have a whole group of state who be test and their positivity rate be under percent we know what it look like on the logarithmic curve you ’ re in the percent then percent then percent and then percent that ’ s what we ’ re try to prevent and it ’ s the metro areas that be absolutely crucial in this and so if you ’ re in a metro area or you ’ re in a small city please make sure all of your friends and family be follow the guidelines that ’ s the best thing we can do the president no because i saw those pen go five minutes ago they be so — they be thrill and the fact be — yes we compare them to italy one place but we have many place that be — dr birx yes the president — really do great and i think that ’ s what deborah mean she didn ’ t mean all of them so when you write your story tomorrow maybe you ’ ll write it correctly she be talk about one state and another state be you know have a hard time it ’ s — and they ’ re closely associate and by the way the people be do a very good job include the people that live there but when deborah be talk about italy she be talk about the one and then the other be lower and then you have mostly state that have be unbelievable so she wasn ’ t talk about the average of everything she be talk about an individual state which be i think still better than italy italy be have a hard time by the way spain be have a hard time france be have a hard time but our state generally speak it ’ s like lot of different countries all over we have — many of those countries be do a phenomenal job they ’ re really flat and i think that ’ s what you mean dr birx thank you sir the president i don ’ t know i don ’ t want to — i don ’ t want to speak for — but i think — that ’ s what i understand she mean yeah please can i ask a question about that though because coronavirus be present in all state you say before that you — when you implore mayors and governors to be serious about this you say “ once it show up mitigation efforts be too late ” so how do you then square that with this notion that some state be do well i mean the virus doesn ’ t abide by state law the president because some state they stay in better they ’ re not touch they ’ re not — whatever it be they ’ re not go out they ’ re not in group and some state be not probably as good or for whatever reason or they also live a lot closer you know new york be very dense and you know california be pretty dense too and they ’ ve get a very good record go so far we hope it doesn ’ t spike up but it ’ s very flat we have state that be do incredibly well i mean when i look at some of them i look at some state that i would have think maybe wouldn ’ t have do as well and they ’ re really flatlined hope they stay that way i hope they stay that way isn ’ t that the point mr president the president say it jeff sir isn ’ t that the point that you want those state to stay flatlined the president i want them — yeah that ’ s what i ’ m say i mean it seem like you ’ re — the president no no no but when deborah mention about italy and our country she wasn ’ t refer to our country she be refer to one state but she ’ s encourage people to do a better job of follow these social distance measure that ’ s what i ’ m understand it the president okay so my understand — i ’ m go to let her say it but i think that everybody would have to be thrill with the way most state be do thrill i don ’ t think she — be that what you mean the president the flatline — the flatline state — state that have almost no bump i mean i would think now then you have others where for whatever reason they ’ re higher that ’ s different but you can ’ t condemn people live in a flatliner with people live in something where there ’ s the big bump or the bigger bump or more akin to italy where they have some very unique problems in all fairness to italy they have some very unique problems but if you ’ d like to come up and — so how many flatline do we have the president a lot of them and how many do we have — how many how many do we have dr birx so why don ’ t i bring you the whole deck again and we ’ ll divide out the state so you can see them the vice president we ’ ll do it tomorrow dr birx because you really have to see each state separately that ’ s why i start with there be state where you ’ ve hear me talk about how concern i be these be state that before the guidelines go out or right after the guidelines go out — i mean you can look at — it ’ s on the website if you go to the healthdataorg about when governors make clarity about close their state as far as the social distance the wash of the hand the bar the take — do takeout and you can line that up with the presidential guidelines and not all state when the presidential guidelines come out immediately follow the presidential guidelines not all state do there be state that also may have get many more seed from outside communities that certainly be one of the issue that new york and new jersey connecticut and rhode island be face the virus come in from multiple place into those state it be undetected early on and they have a very logarithmic curve what i be say be even one of those curve in one county in one city be one curve too many so i be passionate about everyone follow the guidelines because of the outlier curve maybe that be a better way of put it the president yeah that ’ s exactly — dr birx the outlier curve — the president i think that ’ s perfect dr birx — in specific counties be to make sure that doesn ’ t happen anywhere else so would you feel better if every state do a stayathome order would you feel better dr birx well i think most of the state have do that i think if you — one death from this be one death too many i mean i come out of epidemics and pandemics we know what to do i know we don ’ t have a vaccine and i know we don ’ t have a therapeutic but we know what can be do and others be do it and most of the people in the unite state be do it it ’ s our communities — it ’ s every american that have to make these change and i know they ’ re really hard and i know it ’ s hard to remember i mean i have to say to myself every day because i ’ m around very important people to like never touch anything and i ’ m just like paranoid now about touch things i ’ m sure you all be too i mean we ’ ve get to the place where we don ’ t go to your place on pebble beach we go to the one that ’ s open air because i mean you ’ re try to protect your reporters i mean i understand that we ’ re all try to protect each other and we all have to adapt to this new reality that we ’ re in right now and i believe everybody be try really hard and i ’ m just ask them to try really really hard for these next days because they will make a tremendous difference we see that evidence and so it ’ s like have a vaccine or a therapeutic because we know what work and we ’ re ask everybody to apply what work and i know it take amaze attention to detail because you know the minute you forget or do something you ’ re like “ oh my gosh i should have never do that ” and that ’ s the level of attention it take if cover our face could help us do that and guidelines be come out — the president so i just want to say — look many state have start low and slow and then they stay at a good level some really stay at a great level some — louisiana as an example it be low and slow and they be look great i be watch it because you know it ’ s kind of a place people go to with mardi gras — which sort of be an interest point because after mardi gras it be low and then all of a sudden it go up very rapidly and now it ’ s one of our true hotspots right certain areas of michigan — detroit be — it look like it be do pretty good and then all of a sudden it go up so you have that too but i ’ ll tell you what we have state that have be really incredible in the fact that they have keep so — so low they have not — you haven ’ t see the bump and i hope you don ’ t i hope you don ’ t and you have a couple that for a lot of different reason — and that ’ s not to blame anybody but they be at a higher level but very few i think deborah — i mean i may say i think most people have actually follow the presidential — you can call them whatever you want i would never use the word “ dictate ” because if i use that word i would be in such trouble in fact you ’ ll put me in trouble just that i even mention the think of it okay but we make a recommendation and i think they ’ ve do a good job and maybe they start a little later but maybe they ’ re also more difficult state but we ’ ve do i think on average really phenomenally as a country i think we ’ ve do phenomenally because when you look at that graph the other day — i don ’ t know if you saw it i assume you saw it everybody in the world saw it but you look at all those line on the bottom — one color after another all different represent different state — it ’ s all crowd at the bottom and then you have two that be up but you have — i don ’ t know almost every one of them be down low very low so there be a lot of people listen and i just do — i want to be clear because i don ’ t need headline tomorrow and neither do the country because i don ’ t want this country work so hard and then have press that be in this case maybe misinterpret something because i might have — i might have — when i hear it i be surprise at first too but i understand what deborah mean mr president — can you clear something else up again the president but i think it ’ s very important — because i think it ’ s very important for you to be accurate one other thing just a quick thing so what i find be when governors call me — i mean i think in every case they ’ ve always be so nice so nice and i ’ ve see them and hear them say “ thank you very much you have do a great job ” “ a fantastic job ” in one case “ thank you thank you thank you then i ’ ll see the governor usually of the opposite party in almost all case except maybe one — but in almost all case they ’ re very generous they ’ re very nice they thank me everything be great we ’ re do a great job and then i ’ ll see them on television and just like a different person and i realize there be some people because of politics that if they say “ we want ventilators ” and i ’ ll say “ no jim i want to give you ventilators they ’ ll say “ thank you you be the greatest president that ’ s ever live and then i ’ ll see them quote in a paper or see them on a show and they ’ ll say “ the president didn ’ t come through for me i ’ m very disappoint in the president ” and we have a lot of that they ’ re very happy when they talk to me and then i see them but there be some people if they ask for of something and if i give them they will say — you ’ ll say “ how ’ s the president do “ well we don ’ t like the job to my face they ’ re very nice but then sometimes — i guess they assume i don ’ t watch them or something but i watch very closely yeah please mr president one especially vulnerable population be the prison population and that ’ s — especially with jar here i wonder if you could address what the federal government be do to protect inmates the president well it ’ s vulnerable in that it ’ s close together really i — i can ’ t tell you about age but a lot of young people in prison some people — some state — i have not do that at all but some state be let people out of prison some people be get out that be very serious criminals in some state and i don ’ t like that i don ’ t like it but it ’ s a city or state thing in certain case as you know i think maybe philadelphia come to mind so we ’ ll see you have to see what what ’ s go on and we don ’ t like it the people don ’ t like it and we ’ re look in to see if i have the right to stop it in some case okay mr president million americans file for unemployment last week we haven ’ t hear you talk a lot today about what they ’ re go through so what ’ s — the president oh i think it ’ s — — your message to them and — the president i think they ’ re go through i think it ’ s terrible so look four weeks ago we have the greatest economy in the history of the world the greatest in the world — greatest in the history of the world we have the most job ever in the history of the unite state almost million job right and then one day i get a call from deborah who ’ s fantastic and from dr fauci and he say and she say “ we have a problem i say “ what ’ s the problem and they say “ we may have to close it up i say “ close what up they say “ close up the country and i say “ what ’ s that all about and we discuss today — and probably not since we come to that conclusion — and she be a fantastic person a brilliant person and this be what she know i say “ have it ever be this bad and i think i can represent that you say “ no and part of it — it ’ s a contagion it ’ s so contagious it ’ s like if you sneeze i probably get it whoever hear of a thing like that okay and this very talented reporter be bail out okay he ’ s out of here i don ’ t blame you but it ’ s a very contagious thing and — probably the like of which we ’ ve never see in term of that but — so that ’ s over years ago but that be — you know it ’ s be write about many many time that be a horrible — whether it be or million people — i ’ ve hear from to i ’ ve hear to — but it be tens of millions of people now we have the advantage of communication this could have be just as bad i mean here we can read on the internet we can see what to do we can have these meet they can watch on television which they do a lot of people be watch a lot of people be watch and they say “ gee social distance ” but in they didn ’ t have that option you know they didn ’ t know what to do they just notice people be die all over the place think of it to million people die a lot of people in this country die i always — to me it ’ s a great — it ’ s a great question how come more people didn ’ t die in this country and they say it actually start in this country and go to europe i mean we lose a lot of people but relatively we lose very few compare to europe so this be a terrible thing that happen and what ’ s happen now with people and job — so think of the position i ’ m in we have build all together everybody — not me everybody — the greatest economy in history and all of a sudden people come in that we respect and we know and here ’ s the thing they be right everybody question it for a while not everybody but a good portion question it they say “ let ’ s keep it open let ’ s ride it if we do that — you saw the other graph and whether it ’ s true or almost true or maybe not true enough — the number be million people would have die million people would have die in a short period of time in fact the graph could have be even shorter i always notice that that horrible one — where it go high — it actually come down a little bite faster it might have be over faster and you would have lose million people so they come in and they say “ we have to close up the country and i say “ you know what that do to this — to the fabric of this country to people that have great job great family no problems with money their — everything be perfect then all of a sudden they go from that to have no job in one day they never even think of it and then you see million people unemployed unemployment number get release and you see million people and it ’ s an artificial close it ’ s not like we have a massive recession or worse it ’ s artificial because we turn it off think of all we ’ re do we ’ re say “ don ’ t go to work and we ’ ll pay you everything be the opposite it be always “ go to work and make a lot of money and do well and — the american dream because of a hide enemy we ’ re say “ don ’ t go to work and we ’ re go to pay you ” look at the money trillion and we will probably do more i think infrastructure would be a fantastic thing to do you want to get the restaurants back you give deductibility you understand what that be you give deductibility for businesses where they go and they use the restaurants the restaurants will be bigger and better than they be before you know people don ’ t know a lot of restaurants close when they end deductibility and then they start do well but they have fewer restaurants but the boom of the restaurants be when they have deductibility where corporations could use them so — and entertainment that be a great thing but they close it and then they close it again and it wasn ’ t the same but if you want to get them back you do that but infrastructure we borrow our money now at zero you know if be pay percent percent percent it ’ s a different ballgame we ’ re borrow — we can borrow long term for zero — literally zero you know that — because we ’ re consider the safe investment all over the world they want money in the unite state that ’ s where they want the money so i know better than anybody i just — i know what they ’ re go through and it ’ s horrible but you know what i want to do i want to be able to get them back fast when this be over it ’ s go to be a day we ’ re go to celebrate because everyone be go to go to work and i think we ’ re go to have boom time i think it ’ s go to be great and we ’ ve learn a lot we ’ ve learn about border we ’ ve learn about reliance on other countries we ’ ve learn so much — so much that i think we really have a chance to be bigger and better and stronger and i think it ’ s go to come back very quickly but first we have to defeat this enemy so we will see you tomorrow thank you very much thank you end pm edt</td>\n",

had a meeting with kevin mccarthy future speaker of the house i hope  and he’s done a fantastic job for the people of california  and also the people of california have done a fantastic job when you look at the — at the bump  you take a look at the bump and how they’re doing out there  so i congratulate everybody out there but i thought i’d have kevin say a few words  so kevin please leader mccarthy  well thank you mr president  and i would like to thank you  on the basis of california governor newsom says the work that you’re doing together has been — you’re working very closely — has been effective in california as well — the vice president and the president you know today mr president i want to thank you especially for the work that secretary mnuchin has done especially for small businesses  just today alone i saw bank of america had more than  loans in two hours and for anybody who’s in small business — my first small business was when i was  years old  you don’t have income coming in right now you get a loan but for your rent paying your employees and paying your utilities is a grant  that’s part of the cares act  and i think you’re going to find that a lot of small businesses are going to hire people back keep them afloat through the next two months and get this economy moving again as we get through this virus  so i just want to thank you for all that work the president  thank you  great job you’re doing leader mccarthy  thank you the president  thank you  you go ahead  i’ll talk to you later okay thank you very much everybody  and i want to start by saying that our hearts go out to the people of new york as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in america  that seems to be the hotspot right now  but you have some others as you know that are very — very bad  very bad  louisiana is getting hit very hard  parts of michigan are getting hit very very hard  new jersey is — is –surprisingly it’s much greater than anybody would have thought  they’re doing a really good job  the governor is doing a really good job out there new york’s first responders emts doctors nurses are showing incredible courage under pressure  they’re the best in the world  we will take every action and we’ll spare no resource — financial medical scientific  we will not spare anything  we’ll get it back into shape the empire state — the governor is doing an excellent job  they’re all working very hard together  at the request of the governor as you know the javits center we have  beds and we’re going to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be looked after the patients can be looked after  that was going to be for regular medical problems such as accidents  and you know it’s very interesting the governor is telling me we don’t have too many accidents and very few people driving so we’re going to put that facility into play which is a big facility  the ship will be staying the way it is but we’re putting that facility into play to help them and today also the cdc is announcing additional steps americans can take to defend against the transmission of the virus  from recent studies we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood  so you don’t seem to have symptoms and it still gets transferred in light of these studies the cdc is advising the use of nonmedical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure  so it’s voluntary you don’t have to do it  they suggested for a period of time  but this is voluntary  i don’t think i’m going to be doing it but you have a lot of ways — you can look at it as follows the cdc is recommending that americans wear a basic cloth or a fabric mask that can be either purchased online or simply made at home  probably material that you’d have at home  these face coverings can be easily washed or reused i want to emphasize that the cdc is not recommending the use of medicalgrade or surgicalgrade masks and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard and doing some job  medical protective gear must be reserved for the frontline healthcare workers who are performing those vital services the new mask guidelines also do not replace cdc’s guidance on social distancing including staying in your home when possible standing at least six feet apart for a period of time  again we’re going to all come back together here  we’re going to all come back together  and practicing hand hygiene which we should do anyway a lot of things i think are going to spill over  shaking hands maybe will stay with our country for a long time beyond this  one of the — one of our great doctors was telling me that — as you know we have flus every year and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial  and said that if they didn’t shake hands that number would be substantially lower  so maybe it’ll stay  maybe some of these things long term will be good  but those guidelines are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection so with the masks it’s going to be really a voluntary thing  you can do it  you don’t have to do it  i’m choosing not to do it but some people may want to do it and that’s okay  it may be good  probably will  they’re making a recommendation  it’s only a recommendation  it’s voluntary we’re also taking action to ensure the cost of no barrier to any american seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus  the largest insurer nationwide the bluecross blueshield system has now announced that it will not require any copays — which is really something that’s a tremendous statement — from patients of the virus treatment for the next  days similar to the commitments of cigna humana anthem  those are great companies and they’re all doing the same thing  so copays  for them to do that is — it’s a big statement  we appreciate it today i can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treating uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government using funds from the economic relief package congress passed last month  so that was as per the question yesterday and actually the day before yesterday  this should alleviate any concern uninsured americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment  so that’s i think answers the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people i’m also signing a directive invoking the defense production act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supplies by unscrupulous actors and profiteers the security and secretary — the secretary of homeland security will work with fema to prevent the export of  respirators surgical masks gloves and other personal protective equipment  we need these items immediately for domestic use  we have to have them  but we’ve done really well with the purchase of items and you’ll be hearing about that shortly we’ve already leveraged the dpa to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supplies  under that authority this week the department of health and human services working with the department of justice took custody of nearly   respirators  surgical masks  gloves as well as bottles — many many many bottles — and disinfectant sprays that were being hoarded  all of this material is now being given to healthcare workers  most of it has already been given out  and we’ve given a lot to new york a lot in new jersey a lot to other places in addition to ensure that healthcare workers in new york have the protective equipment they need the federal government in the name of the department of defense is providing about  million  respirators  department of defense  and we’ve already given  of them to new york city  mayor de blasio needed them very badly so we got them to mayor de blasio in new york city  and they were very grateful   million  and we’re going to be increasing that number from  million to more  that’s a lot of  respirators today my team spoke with the ceo of ochsner health and the ceo of lcmc the two largest health systems in new orleans  they said they feel that they currently have enough ventilators — i think a lot of people are going to have enough ventilators — and masks and appreciate what we did and all of the things we’ve been doing with them working with them the ceo of ochsner warner thomas — who’s really been fantastic i have to say — indicated a need for  surgical gowns  and i instructed fema to deliver them tomorrow  so they’ll have the   that’s louisiana — new orleans  two hundred and thirty thousand surgical gowns they’ll have them by tomorrow we’re expanding the role of the armed forces in our response effort because no one is better prepared to win a war than the united states military  and we are in a war  the invisible enemy — remember over  retired army medical personnel have answered their nation’s call and are now supporting field hospitals and medical facilities all across the country like what i just told you that governor cuomo requested we do something in javits where we take it over  and we’re going to have that manned by the military because it’s very tough to get people — more people in the new york area  so we’re going to have it manned by the military — javits center national guard members have been activated to help states build new treatment centers and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supplies  that includes national guard  the national guard is assisting very strongly because the states were in many cases unable to have the delivery capability from warehouses and other places that we put the supplies  so i’ve given approval to use the national guards — the various national guards in the different states  and they’re doing a fantastic job of not only protecting people but delivering material the army corps of engineers has assessed more than  facilities in all  states and is rapidly building temporary hospitals and alternative care sites in many states in new york new jersey michigan pennsylvania arizona california colorado florida illinois new mexico oregon washington wisconsin ohio  they’re doing a lot of work in just those states plus additionals that are being — will be announced probably tomorrow  but they’re doing some job  the army corps of engineers — what a job they’re doing  and fema — what a job they’re doing as we deploy the power of our military we’re also deploying the skill of our doctors scientists and medical researchers  we continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies and the treatment and prevention of the virus  and we will keep the american people fully informed on our findings  hydroxychloroquine — i don’t know it’s looking like it’s having some good results  i hope that — that would be a phenomenal thing but we have it right now in — approximately now it’s increased to  people  i spoke with dr zucker in new york — terrific guy by the way  he’s — we’re doing a good job  and i spoke to governor cuomo last evening and this morning about it  so it’s been there for about three and a half days but i think — and many other places it’s being tested too  and we have a tremendous supply of it  we’ve ordered it in the case that it works  and it’s — it could have some pretty big impacts  and we’ll see what happens my administration is also working to get relief to american workers and businesses  on day one of the paycheck protection program as kevin said more than  billion in guaranteed loans have been processed to help small businesses keep their workers employed during the unprecedented time — this unprecedented time and bank of america has been incredible  of the big banks bank of america has really stepped forward and done a great job and then you have the community banks your smaller banks  and we’re already at  billion going out to incredible people  but that’s way ahead of schedule the sba and the treasury are working around the clock and our banking partners are really incredible  and they’re ensuring that the money gets to small businesses as quickly as possible and then the small business in turn take care of employees that they would have had to let go and now they’ll keep them  and that’s good  and then they’re going to open for business and they’re going to have their employees  and we’ll try and get back to where we were  eventually we’re going to supersede where we were the energy industry has been especially hard hit in the crisis  this afternoon i met with greg garland of phillips  dave hager of devon energy harold hamm of continental resources jeff hildebrand of hilcorp energy vicki hollub of occidental petroleum mike sommers of the american petroleum institute kelcy warren of energy transfer partners mike wirth of chevron and darren woods of exxon mobil  i informed them that we will be making space available in the strategic petroleum reserve to let american producers store surplus oil that can be sold at a later time there’s a tremendous abundance of oil primarily because of the virus  the virus has just stopped demand of everything including oil  so we’re working with our great energy companies  these are great companies  they employ tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people  and they’ve kept america really going for a long time  and no big price hikes no big anything  i mean they’ve just kept it going  and now they got hit  but with all the jobs and all of the good that they do we’re going to make sure that they stay in good shape america is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens our future society  our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time  and we want them to stay healthy for a long time  so stay at home  this is ending  this will end  you’ll see some bad things and then you’re going to see some really good things  and it’s not going to be too long we will heal our citizens and we will care for our neighbors and we will unleash the full might of the united states of america to vanquish the virus and with that i’d like to ask mike pence to come up vice president and say a few words  and we’ll have a couple of other quick talks on a couple of subjects and we’ll take questions and it’s a beautiful friday in washington dc and our country is a great place and we’re getting better  we’re getting better very quickly this was artificially induced  we just said — they said “close it down  you have to close it down  we closed it down and we’re healing  we’re going to get it better fast so mike if you could come up say a few words  please the vice president  thank you mr president  the president just outlined a number of the decisions that he made today on the unanimous recommendation to the white house coronavirus task force in addition some good news dr deborah birx will reflect on in a moment  and some of the areas across america where we see evidence that the mitigation efforts — the american people putting into practice the president’s coronavirus guidelines — are having a positive effect in fact today california and washington state where the coronavirus first emerged in our country remain — the cases remain at a steady but low rate  and we know as governor newsom said yesterday that they’re not out of the woods yet  we continue to flow resources but we want to commend people in those states and all across the country who are putting into practice the social distancing and all the measures that state and local leaders are advising and that — and that the president has been advising in the coronavirus guidelines for america we’re also continuing to track significant outbreaks in new york state new orleans detroit chicago and boston  and as the president indicated we’re prioritizing resources to support healthcare workers and to support those that are dealing with the coronavirus in those communities on the subject of testing now more than  million tests have been performed across the country  and as you all are aware some  americans have tested positive for the coronavirus abbott instruments which now can perform a  test across the country have literally  of their machines across the nation today  but at the president’s direction fema is acquiring over  more machines to distribute to every state public health lab in america and also to our indian healthcare service and the big news of course over the last few days was that the fda — once again in near record time — has approved an antibody test developed by cellex  and we’re continuing on the white house coronavirus task force to examine ways that we can scale up these rapid tests and these innovative new tests not just to meet this moment but to lay a foundation for testing across the nation in the months ahead as the president mentioned he met with energy executives today and continues to engage with leaders of businesses all across the nation we also have held a teleconference today with commercial retailers  on the president’s behalf we thanked them for the way that people that operate malls and shopping centers around the country have embraced and enacted the coronavirus guidelines for america  it’s had enormous impact on their businesses and their industries  but i heard — i heard from them their — their patriotic commitment to put the health of their associates and their customers first  and it was deeply inspiring on the subject of supplies the president detailed our work in that space  it continues to this day  as part of our air bridge we had a flight arrive from china today to columbus ohio  we continue to work each and every day watching the data about cases to ensure that in particular not just the personal protective equipment is available for the healthcare workers that are on the frontlines but also that ventilators are available as the — as this epidemic makes its way through regions and communities  we are literally working hour by hour day by day to make sure that patients families and healthcare providers have the equipment and the support that they need as the president mentioned we’ve seen over a billion and a half dollars in loans go out through the paycheck protection program today we have available for questions the head of the cdc today to speak about the new guidance on cloth face coverings and secretary azar in a few moments will explain just how the president’s decision to make sure that no american will ever have to worry about paying for testing or for coronavirus treatment i’m pleased to report at the president’s direction medicaid and medicare already expanded to coronavirus treatment and testing early on and of course the president just indicated how major insurance companies across the country are not just waiving copays on testing but they’re now waiving copays for at least  days on any coronavirus treatment but now as secretary azar will enumerate now we’ll make sure that any american even those that have no insurance will be able to receive treatment in a hospital and never have to worry about the bill i’ll just give a general reminder to every american there is evidence across the country that you’re putting into practice the coronavirus guidelines for america  every american has a role to play  and i want to thank you on behalf of the president and all of the american people for the way that you’re stepping forward you’re engaging in the social distancing and doing the things that will slow the spread we encourage you to keep on keeping on  and we will get through this america  we will get through the coronavirus to that day of renewed health and renewed prosperity that the president always describes  but we’ll get through there sooner and we’ll get through there when we work together dr birx dr birx  thank you mr vice president mr president  thank you for your words of discipline and determination  i guess that really describes what we’re asking every american to really be disciplined about these guidelines and really determined to stay in that space of execution you know we are just in week three on — of this full guidance measure  we really do appreciate the work of the citizens of california and washington state because we do see that their curve is different  their curve is different from new york new jersey and connecticut  and we really believe that the work that every citizen is doing in those states is making a difference and it will make a difference for the frontline healthcare providers we also are deeply grateful despite the way their curve looks today they continue to get ready for a different potential so that they can ensure that patients if they do get sick have options and availability to all the frontline healthcare workers in the — what we have referred to as “hot zones” — areas where the number of cases are quite significant — the new orleans the new york city metro area including new jersey and connecticut — the incredible work that the frontline healthcare workers are providing  we’re really working now at a much more granular level talking directly to hospitals to ensure that they have the supplies that they need in coordination with state and local governments and to work — i think we discussed it yesterday but i think it was quite clear also — and reiterated by governor cuomo today — that we have to support one another as each of these different metro areas and other areas move through their peak of new infections when we talked about it at the beginning of this week we talked about this week and next week being incredibly difficult  and we want to recognize the number of americans who have lost their lives to this virus and recognize the sacrifice that healthcare providers are making both in their care but i think i’m very uplifted by hearing their messages to families and their compassion for others to provide that kind of support to the individuals in the hospital we continue to watch in addition the chicago area the detroit area and have some developing concerns around colorado the district of columbia and pennsylvania  so as you can see each of these will follow their own curves  we’ll be getting more and more of those case over time information in a very granular way to each and every one of you so that we can follow these epidemiologic curves as each of these states counties and communities move through this together in solidarity and really ensuring that we can move supplies creatively around the country to meet the needs of both the frontline healthcare providers but also every american who needs our support right now thank you the president  thank you very much secretary azar  well thank you mr president for your continued leadership as we battle the coronavirus  first i want to thank all of the members of the hhs team and the frontline healthcare workers across america including those who — those service workers who serve in our hospitals at our healthcare facilities those who clean those who deliver those who stock the shelves — all those who are going into battle every day against the virus  your country has asked you to serve as never before and you have responded heroically i’m going to provide a brief update on the administration’s plans to cover the testing and treatment for the uninsured  getting the uninsured access to the care they need is a top priority for president trump  we are already rolling out the  billion in funding from the families first coronavirus response act to cover providers’ expenses for testing and diagnosing the uninsured the cares act signed by the president includes another  billion for healthcare providers  under the president’s direction we will use a portion of that funding to cover providers’ costs of delivering  care for the uninsured sending the money to providers through the same mechanism used for testing as a condition of receiving funds under this program providers will be forbidden from balance billing the uninsured for the cost of their care  providers will be reimbursed at medicare rates we will soon have more specifics on how the rest of the  billion will go to providers  we’re working to ensure that this funding is distributed in a way that is fast fair simple and transparent i’d also like to remind people that if you’ve lost employer insurance coverage you have insurance options that you should look into  you’d be eligible for a special enrollment period on the healthcare exchanges and depending on your state you may be eligible for medicaid just as president trump is working to ensure that  treatment is paid for he’s working to support new treatment options for patients  thanks to the president’s leadership many providers are trying different experimental therapies and we need as much data as we can collect as quickly as possible on how these treatments are working today oracle has developed and is donating to the government and the american people a web portal and platform to gather crowdsourced realtime information from providers about how patients respond to potential therapeutics  while this doesn’t replace the important work of clinical trials it gives us data rapidly  if you are a doctor or a healthcare provider and you would like to help us you can sign up today to begin reporting on your work  there’s a special registration page for providers at  thank you very much the president  thank you very much  okay let’s go  steve    if we could draw you out a little bit more on the advice on face masks  what do — what would people gain from wearing a mask  and why are you opposed to wearing one yourself the president  well i just don’t want to wear one myself  it’s a recommendation they recommend it  i’m feeling good  i just don’t want to be doing — i don’t know somehow sitting in the oval office behind that beautiful resolute desk — the great resolute desk — i think wearing a face mask as i greet presidents prime ministers dictators kings queens i don’t know  somehow i don’t see it for myself  i just — i just don’t  maybe i’ll change my mind but this will pass and hopefully it’ll pass very quickly now with that being said if somebody wants to — i mean most people can just make something out of a certain material  so it’s very well designated it’s very simple to do  i won’t be doing it personally  it’s a recommendation  okay and would you like to say something about that surgeon general adams  sure  absolutely the president  surgeon general please surgeon general adams  well thank you mr president mr vice president mr secretary and cdc director redfield  i especially want to thank the folks at the cdc  and it’s a great question that you ask it’s a fair question that you ask  i want to unpack the evolution of our guidance on masks because it has been confusing to the american people first of all i want people to understand that the cdc the world health organization my office and most public health and health organizations and professionals originally recommended against the general public wearing masks because based on the best evidence available at the time it was not deemed that that would have a significant impact on whether or not a healthy person wearing a mask would contract  we have always recommended that symptomatic people wear a mask because if you’re coughing if you have a fever if you’re symptomatic you could transmit disease to other people what has changed in our recommendation  well it’s important to know that we now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms  they’re what we call asymptomatic  and that even those who eventually become presymptomatic meaning that they will develop symptoms in the future can transmit the virus to others before they show symptoms  this means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity for example coughing speaking or sneezing even if those people were not exhibiting symptoms in light of this new evidence cdc recommends and the task force recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain  these include places like grocery stores and pharmacies  we especially recommend this in areas of significant communitybased transmission  it is critical and the president mentioned this the vice president mentioned this it’s critical to emphasize that maintaining six feet of social distancing remains key to slowing the spread of the virus but cdc is additionally advising the use of simple cloth coverings to slow the spread of the virus and to help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others the cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or  respirators  those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders as recommended by the current cdc guidance as the president also mentioned cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional voluntary public health measure this recommendation complements and does not replace the president’s coronavirus guidelines for america “ days to slow the spread” which remains the cornerstone of our national effort to slow the spread of the virus cdc is always — always looking at the data  we told you that from the beginning — dr birx says it every single press conference — we’re looking at the data we’re evolving our recommendations and new recommendations will come as the evidence dictates so i want to say if you do choose to wear a face mask — very important — wash your hands first because you don’t want to put on a face covering with a dirty hand  do not touch your face while you are wearing the face covering because again you could take materials from the surface germs from the surface and bring it to your face  if you choose to wear a face covering please — please leave the  mask the medical supplies for the medical professionals healthcare workers and frontline workers know that this is not a substitute for social distancing  and remember this is all about me protecting you and you protecting me  this is about us coming together as communities  and if people voluntarily choose to wear a face covering they’re wearing it to protect their neighbors from getting the coronavirus because again they could have asymptomatic spread so mr president thank you very much for that the president  thank you  thank you surgeon general adams  appreciate the opportunity to update everyone the president  great job  thank you okay  jon    mr president dr fauci last night recommended — said that every state should have stayathome orders right now  do you agree with that  should every state in this country have the kind of stayathome orders that we now see in places like washington and new york the president  i leave it up to the governors  the governors know what they’re doing  they’ve been doing a great job  i guess we’re close to  percent anyway  and the states that we’re talking about are not in jeopardy  no i would leave it to the governors  i like — i like that from the standpoint of governing and i like that from the standpoint of even our constitution please    mr president to address the shortage in the blood supply the food and drug administration announced yesterday — the president  well i pointed to him  right    thanks mr president the president  i knew we inaudible  i heard a different voice  i heard a different voice go ahead  we’ll get you later    going to the oil meeting previously — the president  yeah    — is the us willing to cut domestic oil production  what came out of the meeting  what was the consensus the president  well a lot of things came out  it’s a great industry it’s an important industry it’s a tremendous jobproducing industry  and it’s just vital  and it was also very interesting because they all were given the test before they came into the room  so you have the head of exxon mobil you have all these guys taking the test and they all passed with flying colors  so that was good  they left happy in that respect at least there’s just an overabundance of oil right now — oil and gas  tremendous overabundance  and it was caused — they were doing a great job  they were producing a lot of energy  but then you have the virus come along and it knocked another  percent maybe  percent off of the market so there’s too much oil  there’s a glut  and these are great companies and they’ll figure it out  it’s free market  we’ll figure it out    you spoke to president putin  i mean what’s on the table here with him — the president  and with the crown prince  both    yeah the president  they were having a competition  we’ll see how it all works out  i think it’s going to work out very well  it’s going to take a long time to — to get rid of that  there’s massive excess amount of oil and gas  massive  like probably there’s never been so where that does work out well i guess you could say is for drivers  i think in certain locations it’s down to  and  cents a gallon right now on the road but we have a tremendous industry a great industry  a tremendously important industry from the standpoint of jobs  and we’re energy independent  we have to make sure we keep it that way all right please  go ahead    mr president as i was saying the food and drug administration to address the shortage of blood supply announced yesterday it would ease the restrictions on certain donors including gay men who are now required to be abstinent for  months as opposed to  months to donate  did you have a hand in that change the president  no i didn’t know anything about that  that was done by the fda — very capable people at the fda please go ahead    yes mr president  both the government of canada and  are pushing back on this dpa not to export  respirators the president  yeah     says — the president  i don’t blame them  they can push back if they want    yeah but they’re saying — the president  we’re not happy with   we’re not happy  and the people that dealt with it directly are not at all happy with  so we’ll see whether or not we do  i heard what he had to say today  i don’t know the gentleman  but we’re not happy with   go ahead    and where is dr fauci the president  i don’t know  but every time you ask that question — whenever he’s not here you look you say “where is he  and you’ll say “is there a problem  no problem whatsoever  every time he’s not here — sometimes i’ll ask him to come because that’s the first question that you and a couple of others from the fake news establishment ask is “where is dr fauci  we’re doing great together    a different subject if i may ask the president  except we’re covering a different subject today go ahead    a different subject if i may ask the president   go ahead jim  try another one    mr president you have you have said nobody could have seen this pandemic coming but in fact secretary azar at a biodefense summit in april of  said “of course the people” — “of course the thing that people ask ‘what keeps you most up at night in the biodefense world’ pandemic flu of course  i think everyone in this room probably shares that concern  your own health and human services secretary was aware that this had the potential of being a very big problem around the world a pandemic of this nature  who dropped the ball the president  well i always knew that pandemics are one of the worst things that could happen  there’s been nothing like this since probably   that was the big one in europe  it started actually here and went to europe  probably  i’ve heard about —    you’ve also said nobody could see this coming the president  excuse me  wait a minute  let me finish  i’ve heard about this for a long time — pandemics  you don’t want pandemics  and i don’t think he was talking about a specific pandemic  he was talking about the threat of a pandemic could happen  and it could happen  most people thought it wouldn’t and most people didn’t understand the severity of it  this is a very severe  what’s happened is very severe  but i’d let you answer that  i assume that he was talking about the concept of a pandemic secretary azar  thank you mr president  actually — absolutely for  years now this country has had a massive effort at the federal state and local level of preparedness for a pandemic  now that largely has been as i said in those remarks about pandemic flu preparedness  we knew about sars we knew about mers which were earlier modifications or variants of the coronavirus  none of those achieved anything like what we’re seeing today but that’s why for successive presidencies including the leadership of president trump there has been a great focus on pandemic preparedness  in fact it was just in november i believe that the president signed the pandemic flu preparedness executive order that we have — and we have also updated the pandemic crisis action plan which has been the playbook from which we’ve been working the pandemic flu plan  again the action plan from which we have been working that coordinates the wholeofgovernment wholeofeconomy approach here so we’ve all been very focused on pandemic preparedness  that’s what we do but this particular strain of pandemic who would — who would have known this particular strain    but secretary azar if you were preparing for a pandemic if this government were preparing for a pandemic why is it we don’t have enough masks  why is it we don’t have enough medical equipment in this country the president  previous administrations gave us very little ammunition for the military and very little shelf space  let me just tell you —    but you’ve been president — the president  you know it —    you’ve been president — the president  you know the answer    — three or four years now the president  the previous administration the shelves were empty  the shelves were empty    you had time to stock the shelves the president  so what you should do is speak to the people from the previous administration jim and ask them that question because —    mr president you’ve been in office — the president  — the shelves were empty    — for almost four years the president  and you know what else  the military shelves were also empty  we had no ammunition literally  and that was said by one of your favorite generals  “we have — sir we have no ammunition  guess what  we had very little medical supply also all right  go ahead please    isn’t that a copout though the president  go ahead    isn’t that a copout the president  we’ll get it back  we’ll get you back    but mr president — the president  we’ll get you back please    but what about that question — the president  jim i said we’ll get you back please go ahead    so i want to ask about the dpa  so you said that there will be a ban on exporting of all — what does it cover  so masks gloves  what else is included in that order the president  it covers everything    and are you concerned — the president  but if somebody ordered — if italy if spain who has big problems — these have — these are countries with tremendous problems — france  if they ordered — if they have longterm orders and they’re in in there and they want to get certain things i’ve let them go out in certain instances because i think it’s only fair  they have problems that are proportionately or relatively bigger than our problems  so if they ordered something and they’re waiting for as an example masks made here and going to italy i’m not going to be stopping that  i think it would be very unfair and by the way speaking about being fair and unfair two very big cruise liners as you know i allowed them to dock today  we worked with the governor of florida as you know ron desantis and we worked on it and we had tremendous security and we took the sick people and we’re working with them  we have doctors  we have great doctors military doctors  and from a humane standpoint not that we’re in love with this — these are two massive ships — but we have to take care of people  we have to take care we sent many back to canada  the canada — the canadians came and worked very closely with us as did the uk  we had a lot of people from the uk  and we take — we took care of the americans  we took care of the sick  we had some people very sick  i think we have three to four maybe five people that had died on the boat  one of the boats actually  and we had to take care of these people so we couldn’t let them float aimlessly into the ocean looking for port as they’ve been doing for a long time  and i made the decision we had to take them in  and homeland security and a lot of other people did a great job but we had to help people  these are people that were very very sick  some were dying  some died please    mr president on dpa — can i just finish please the president  go ahead  yeah  go ahead    mr president your staff they said that people in close proximity to you and the vice president will get a coronavirus test  i’m wondering are you concerned that the people you’ve been hanging around with may have the virus the president  no i’m not concerned  no  i had a test yesterday    but what’s the reason for the order for people who meet with you or talk to you  why should they require coronavirus testing the president  i don’t know  i mean i just — i heard from the oil executives  these are people — most of them had not had the test  and frankly i think they left the room feeling good about a lot of things  but they felt good about the test this was a test that took i guess  minutes to have it finalized  they took the test  i don’t know  i didn’t know they were doing that  maybe they did it just for them  i don’t know  but —    but they’re always going to have to have a test the president  — it seems that a lot of people — because now we have tests that really work well  abbott in this case abbott  we have other tests being developed right now that are also fantastic the original test — the ones we inherited jim as an example they were — they were broken  they were obsolete  they were not good tests  and that’s what we got stuck with  we’ve developed some incredible tests  but this took  to  minutes  and they were all fine    on the dpa sir — the president  go ahead  finish — finish your question    thank you  yeah  so the problem some people have raised is that if the us stopped exporting what you could have is other countries then deciding reciprocally that they are going to stop exporting — the president  sure    — and that the result of that then will be a net decrease in the amount of supplies that american doctors american hospitals have  how do you address that the president  well i address it in the following manner we really are very well supplied  we are not the principal — it’s the hospitals the states the cities  they’re supposed to get everything they can and stock up in case something like this happens  but nobody could ever have assumed that something like this happened so we started supplying we brought tremendous amounts to new york today and over the last few days  we brought them to louisiana  we brought them to michigan  we brought them to los angeles  a lot of equipment  you’ve read the amount of masks that we had  i think i said over  million masks  the  masks  the you know more expensive more complicated better whatever masks — the ones they want to use in the hospitals we have millions of them now and we’ve given them to a lot  we sent to bellevue in new york today — that was for mayor de blasio —  of them  but we have  million we’re going to have more than that  and we’re getting them from various sources including the military  we’re rapidly then replacing them because we have to replace them in case there’s a — another emergency  i would be — gowns too  we have many gowns being delivered and have been delivered our people have done an incredible job  most people have said — now and i said this yesterday — governors have said “thank you very much  great job  if they’re a democrat governor — in some cases not in all cases at all — if i said “here’s  ventilators  how many do you want  “we want   “here’s   you got ’em  but you know what we’re going to do  we’re going to add another   is that good  they said “wow that’s great  and then if jim acosta goes and says “are you happy with the president  “no he should have given us   that’s what’s happening  you know why  because that’s a standard political answer  and that’s a shame because we have done a job like nobody has ever done a job but we’ve just delivered a lot of masks  we’ve just delivered a lot of gowns and protective gear  but you know you’re talking about a massive — you’re talking about a massive number  but as of this morning people were very very happy steve    did oil executives ask you for a bailout of any sort the president  no they didn’t ask for a bailout  no    what did they ask for the president  it was really more of a discussion than asking  we discu — you know we did discuss the concept of tariffs because as you know this was a dispute among a couple of countries that i think they want to be able to get it solved  they had a dispute  they had a competition  but they want to get it resolved russia —    you mean tariffs — tariffs on — the president  — and saudi arabia i think want to get it —    — saudi and russia the president  yeah  i think they want to get it resolved  i think they’re working very hard  i mean they told me they want to get it resolved  they’re working very hard go ahead    president trump thank you  yesterday jared kushner said the notion of the federal stockpile was it’s supposed to be “our” stockpile  it’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use  what did he mean by “our”  and — the president  well why don’t you ask him    and even the fact that taxpayers from every state pays for it — the president  what’s that  a “gotcha”  “i gotcha  you used the word “our”    no it’s not a “gotcha  what did he mean by it the president  “our” — you know what “our” means  united states of america  that’s what it means  it means —   so it means the states the president  our  our  it means the united states of america  and then we take that “our” and we distribute it to the states    so why did he say it’s not supposed — the president  not that we have to —    — to be state stockpiles that they then can use the president  because we need it for the government and we need it for the federal government    to give to the states the president  but when the states are in trouble — no to also keep —    then who are you giving to if it’s not to the states the president  to keep — to keep for our country because the federal government needs it too not just the states  but out of that we oftentimes choose — as an example we have almost  ventilators and we are ready to rock with those ventilators  we’re going to bring them to various areas of the country that need them  but when he says “our” he’s talking about our country  he’s talking —    but he makes the distinction the president  excuse me    and sir — the president  he’s talking about the federal government  i mean it’s such a basic simple question and you try and make it sound so bad    it’s not bad  i’m just trying to — the president  you ought to be — you ought to be ashamed of yourself    — understand  no — by the way secretary azar — the president  you know what  you ought to be ashamed   it’s such a simple question  he said “our  and “our” means for the country and “our” means for the states —    but then he said it’s not supposed to be state stockpiles the president  — because the states are part of the country  don’t make it sound bad  don’t make it sound bad go ahead steve  go ahead back here    but mr president the hhs even changed the language on the website the president  you just asked your question  you just asked your question in a very nasty tone    i don’t think it was nasty the president  let’s go    i think you didn’t give me an answer the president  please    mr president — the president  i gave you a perfect answer  you know it  go ahead    well just to follow up on that when we have the federal stockpile — i mean isn’t that designed to be able to distribute to the states who need it the president  sure  but it’s also needed for the federal government  we have a federal stockpile and they have state stockpiles  and frankly they were — many of the states were totally unprepared for this  so we had to go into the federal stockpile  but we’re not an ordering clerk  they have to have for themselves now some of the states were in good shape  some of the states were not in good shape  that’s probably something you could expect  we have been helping states  we have been spending a tremendous amount of time effort and billions and billions of dollars on making sure that they have what they have i mean take new york we built them hospitals — i built them four hospitals — built them medical centers sent a ship with  rooms and  operating rooms and then on top of that gave vast numbers of ventilators and vast numbers of surgical gowns equipment masks everything else now they had a chance to order ventilators over the years  they had a chance to order a very big — but they didn’t choose to do it  we were there and we helped them  and i think the governor of new york is very thankful for the help that we gave but we have a stockpile  it’s a federal stockpile  we can use that for states or we can use it for ourselves  we do use it for the federal government  we have a very big federal government go ahead    so have you decided not to use your powers to be essentially a traffic cop for all the essential medical supplies that are needed in this the president  well we’re not a traffic cop  we’re a humanitarian cop  we help — it’s like the ships  do you think we wanted to take two big ships into our country that have obvious problems  and you know the problems i’m talking about  so i have a decision to make do i take them in or do i save lives  okay  do i take them in or do i save  i decided to take them in and we have tremendous protection  we have great doctors there to help the people  they had four or five people that died  that was as of last night  they died on the ships  we took care of it  and now the people are in the process of — and many are already back in canada they’re back in the uk — united kingdom  and many of them were american citizens  some were very sick  we’re taking care of the sick people  we’re testing all of the others very very carefully — very very carefully  they are being tested like you wouldn’t believe  and we solve a humanitarian catastrophe  you know why  because nobody else would take the ships  nobody else would take them  so we docked him in i think fort lauderdale    i think some people are wondering why you don’t say “we’re the federal government and there’s a shortage of masks and other things and — the president  we do say that    — we’re going to — the president  we do say that    — sign off on every single shipment– the president  we say we’re — we say and use the act    — that needs to go to places where it needs to go” the president  excuse me we do say that and we use the act  and we’ve used it a number of times very powerfully  and a lot of times we don’t have to use it because we say “we’re going to use it if you don’t do this or that” and then we also have companies that act incredibly well  we have plenty of them — mostly them  but we’ve used the act very powerfully  and a lot of times you don’t have to exercise the act all you have to do is tell them “look if you don’t do this we’re going to use the act” and we’ve done a good job with it — maybe a great job yeah    mr president there are news reports that you want to sign the stimulus checks that are going out here in several months  is that right  do you want to sign those checks the president  no  me sign  no  there’s millions of checks  i’m going to sign them  no  it’s a trump administration initiative  but do i want to sign them  no the people are getting — the people are getting their money  there’s a lot of stimulus going in a lot of different ways  there’s also stimulus going for companies that would — if it weren’t our government would not — and some companies that were very strong a month ago again we had the strongest economy in the world  we had our best ever  we had probably the best economy in the history of the world bigger than china bigger than anybody  and one day we have to say “close it up  stop  everybody go home  and you know what  that’s pretty tough to do that    that’s another thing — that there are rumors that these checks may not go out for another four months like if you don’t have a direct deposit the president  i don’t know  all i can tell you is the small business today is — we’re way ahead of schedule  there is a problem where — and — which i pointed out i said “you shouldn’t do it this way” — with unemployment where  equipment by the states  we’re sending the money to the states  once the money is sent to the states then the states whether they’re republican or democrat have to get the money out to the people  hopefully they’ll be able to do it but many of those states have  computers  i don’t know that they’re equipped  i wanted to give them money direct if that’s what you’re talking about  i wanted to give the money out direct  it would have been much easier  but the democrats and some people said “no let’s do it the complicated way”    i’m talking more about the stimulus checks  the — like — the president  all right well i was talking about —    — when will people get their money the president  excuse me i was talking about both    yeah  when will people get that money the president  yeah they’ll get it  they will go ahead  please    thank you sir  i’d like to ask questions both for myself and some of the other reporters who aren’t in the room social distancing the president  sure    first of all — and this is for yourself and dr birx what percentage of the population do we suspect to be asymptomatic at this point  is there a way to figure that out  it seems like the antibody test might be able to assist in determining that number the president  go ahead deborah dr birx  yeah thank you  so while we’re working diligently in the midst of the crisis to make sure that the healthcare workers and everyone who is sick gets provided for at the same time we’re working on tests and assays that will be critical for surveillance and at the same time working on plans for what we need to do as this moves through the population and we get on the downside where we’re sort of — we’re not there yet  and hopefully most of the states will — say like california and washington  and then what we need to do to be prepared for fall so all three of those things are happening simultaneously and there’s people working on each one of those work streams the antibody piece is critical as you described because at this time we can’t — if we have — let’s say asymptomatic status is inversely — symptomatic status is inversely related to age and so the younger you are the more likely you are to be asymptomatic we have to know that because we have to know how many people have actually become infected so when we talked about five days ago — i think on monday — i called on universities to work on an elisabased test to test for their health workers and really get through that at the same time the private sector is working on tests  and what do we want those tests to be  we want those tests to be like what we use for hiv and malaria — finger prick onto a cassette  you get a line if you’re positive and you get a control line  negative the line isn’t there and there’s the control line  that’s what — that’s our dream assay because it’s a finger prick in the meantime we’re not waiting  i mean we’re pushing for that  at the same time we’re asking to develop an assay — the elisabased assay which requires a tube of blood  and that’s why we’re also talking about could we use dried blood spots we also put out a call directly out to the military because of the roosevelt to really test all of the sailors on the roosevelt with an antibody test to get to this critical issue of asymptomatic and already preexisting antibody  that would be — if the first responders knew they already had had it and they had protective antibody  if the nurses knew the doctors knew if your schoolteacher knew then it’s a very different dialogue  so we understand the importance of that and we understand how important it is in relationship to understanding this epidemic one other comment because i know we’re always saying “who knew what when  i just want to make clear there’s  countries working on this collectively together  it’s devastating for every single country  when we get through this we can go back and look at what happened where and what does this epidemic look like  and when you get through it then you can validate every model there is known to man  when you’re in the middle of it you have to concentrate on serving the needs of each american and what that need looks like at the same time you have these other work streams on surveillance and how to be prepared both scientifically and therapeutically and vaccinewise for the next fall if it happens again so i think these things are happening together but i just want us to really concentrate on the fact that all around the globe country after country is dealing with this  and we can talk about “why didn’t italy do something or spain do something or germany do something  or we can really say “right now we all can we can do something  we can do the social distancing and all of the pieces that we know is starting to work around the globe in country after country and then when we get through all of this we can ask the questions about “could we have done some piece of this better as a global community” i will remind you that on february  the head of the who said there was no reason to ever do a travel ban  you know it wasn’t until january  that we knew that there was humantohuman transmission  remember —    dr birx the president was saying this was going to go away  it’s april the president  it is going to go away  it is going away    the president — but mr president you said it was going to go away in april the president  it’s going — i didn’t say a date    you said “when it warmed up in april…” the president  i said it’s going away and it is going away okay are you —    dr birx — dr birx  yes  thank you sir    but — if i’m — the president  okay that was a good answer to your question  no no no  no no  no more  that was a long but a very good answer  that was enough for you    i have a question on the insurance inaudible coverage  mr president on the insurance coverage for treatment the way your government is going is trying to make sure that people are covered on the treatment for covid — the president yeah we’re going to do that    does that include the  million people who are in this country illegally  are they going to be covered as well the president  we’ll be talking about that at a different time yeah please  go head    yes mr president will you release — authorize the release of the underlying data for the conclusion of the  to  people succumbing  perhaps dr birx can talk — the president  well that’s up to dr birx  you’ll decide as to when — dr birx  we can release all of the — i —    some disease experts have expressed concern that they haven’t seen the underlying data  they’re not questioning — the president  i’m sure they’ll talk to you about that and dr fauci too please go ahead    thank you mr president  this is for you and secretary azar  ten million people say they’ve lost their jobs in the past two weeks  so how is this stimulus money for free treatment going to absorb the new numbers of uninsured and — the president  go ahead if you want — go ahead    — would it not be easier to reopen the obamacare markets or expand medicaid secretary azar  so for an individual who had employer insurance — that’s what i mentioned in my remarks — if you were employed and had insurance through your employer and you’ve now lost your job and lost that insurance you now do have a special enrollment period where you may enroll in the individual exchanges of the affordable care act  so that’s — that’s existing law then what we’re doing is taking from that hundred billion dollars to providers taking money and saying “if you’re a provider and you care for anybody who is uninsured we’re going to compensate you for doing that and we’re going to compensate you at the medicare reimbursement rates and you are not allowed to bill that uninsured individual anything” so in many respects it’s better for those uninsured individuals  they’re going to get firstdollar coverage they’re going to get care in the united states and the provider is going to be made whole from this program  so it’s really an unprecedented — what president trump is doing here with this money is an unprecedented diseasespecific support of care for individuals to make sure that people get treatment    will someone still be billed if they test negative  or what about noncovid conditions    so i just have a couple of questions about supplies — one specifically on new york and the question of ventilators  governor cuomo is saying that new york may be days away from running out of ventilators  can you assure new york that going into next week that they’re going to have the ventilators that they’re going to need the president  no they should’ve had more ventilators at the time  they should have had more ventilators  they were totally under serviced  we are trying to do — we’re doing our best for new york  you know we have — we have states we have a lot of states  we have territories too  but we have a lot of states that have to be taken care of some much more so than others we’ve worked very well with the governor  we happen to think that he’s well served with ventilators  we’re going to find out but we have other states to take care of  we have a big problem in louisiana we have a big problem in michigan we have a big problem in seven other really strong hotspots but we’re doing the best we can  i wish they did the original orders three years ago  they would’ve had all the ventilators they needed  although even then they wouldn’t because if you look at what the original request was from new york it was far greater than anybody ever heard  and we’ve — we’ve supplied a lot  i told you we supplied some just today to new york and we supplied some yesterday to new york city did you have one in the back  yeah please    mr president if i can say — this is why the question about the stockpile that was asked earlier is so important the president  i don’t think that was the question inaudible    no it was a very important question because what jared kushner said yesterday is that the federal stockpile is for use by the federal government not for the states to have access to  so you seem to be saying different  so did jared kushner misspeak yesterday the president  no no he didn’t — he didn’t misspeak    is that federal stockpile available to the states the president  he used the word “our  okay  “our” — “our” is referring to our country    yeah but he said — he said it’s not for the states to use the president  the states to the best of my knowledge and to the best of your knowledge are a part of our country  we are taking what is in the federal stockpile and we are helping states all over the country  but we also want to keep some because when that surge comes when you hit those peaks we’re going to need it  and we have to be able to have the flexibility to take those ventilators and bring them to louisiana new york detroit different places  that’s all    but you will be using them for the states that need them the president  oh of course  we’re not using them anywhere else  we’re not going to be using them jon anywhere else  but we want the flexibility because you know we don’t even know when the surge is coming but it’s coming soon and it’s going to be big and some areas won’t have it some areas will be pleasantly surprised just like we’ve been  you look at the chart  states that i thought would have been maybe a disaster turned out to be — really they’ve done a great job  some states are really troubled but you don’t know  you don’t know  we have great flexibility i would have preferred giving them all out  we’d have nothing  and now when we have a surge we can’t get them back from where we gave them because it’s very tough to take it back  so we have tremendous flexibility  and it could be new york  it could be louisiana  those are two that are really rough  new jersey is very rough  and they’ve done a very good job in new jersey but new jersey is very rough go ahead please in the back    yes the question or — the question is about the cdc guidelines  i know that they changed over time from february and there is — the president the guidelines relative to which — the masks    for instance social distancing and the number of people who can gather in a group and so on  and now we have this — this measure about wearing masks  and i know you told steve about why you don’t want to wear a mask but i’m just wondering if you can tell us more about why because it would set — the president  i’m just don’t choose to    — an example the president  they’re not mandatory guidelines they’re guidelines  they suggest you could wear them  you don’t have to wear them  in fact the director is here  if you want to say a couple of words about it  you don’t — you can if you want  you don’t have to    but what i’m really inaudible your decision not to wear one the president  but basically it’s — it’s a voluntary thing  say it director  he’s doing a good job dr redfield  thank you very much  i think i just want to reemphasize — i’ve said this before — that we’re not defenseless against this virus  we have a powerful tool a powerful weapon that is social distancing  and we’ve continued to embrace that with the president’s initiatives to slow the spread of coronavirus we’re constantly looking at new data  and as the surgeon general said one of the new information that became more clear to all of us is there’s a greater number of people that are asymptomatically infected than we previously thought  as ambassador birx said that may be inversely related to age  and so really the purpose here is first and foremost to embrace the social distancing  that’s the number one thing  that’s the powerful weapon and you know this virus has a great weakness it can’t jump from one person to another if it’s got to swim more than six feet  and this is why we really want that  that said we now know that there may be individuals in signif — areas of significant community transmission that may be asymptomatically infected  and we know that a face barrier can actually interrupt the number of virus particles that can go from one person to the other so as was said by the vice president this is — and the president — the purpose of this face covering is to be another adjunctive mitigation strategy to protect someone from spreading the virus from themselves to someone else the president  and i was just tested also  so i assume i don’t know have the virus so i don’t have to worry about spreading it  okay please go ahead    mr president i want to make sure we’re clear  when you mentioned tariffs earlier — the president  yeah    — that came up in a meeting are you considering tariffs on saudi arabian oil  and then also — the president  well i can always consider — look tariffs have made a tremendous amount of money for our country  i put them on china i put them on other places and other countries tariff us and they take advantage of us and they have for many years look countries have taken advantage of the united states for years  they’ve ripped us off like nobody can even believe whether it be on — on manufacturing whether it be on exporting whether it be on almost anything including military where we provide virtually free military assistance to countries that frankly take advantage of us don’t even like us  okay so this has been going on for years they tariff us  they create artificial — you could say nonfinancial barriers which are worse than financial barriers  you can’t sell your product you can’t take care of our farmers they won’t take our — and yet they’ll take us and sell into us and we won’t charge them anything for doing it  look they’ve taken advantage of us for years tariffs are a way of evening the score  tariffs are a way of just neutralizing  they have tariffs on us  and we now can put tariffs on them  am i using it for oil  it’s something we can  no — am i doing it now  no  am i thinking about imposing it as of this moment  no  but if we’re not treated fairly it’s certainly a tool in the toolbox    and what about with russia  are you — would you consider maybe lifting sanctions or giving some sanctions relief if they — the president  well it would be the same thing  no it would be the same thing  they are having a dispute — the two countries — and it’s hurting the rest of the world because it’s really hurting the energy industry  russia is being hurt unbelievably badly and saudi arabia is being hurt unbelievably badly  because oil and gas is a primary — that’s where they get most of their income  and this is a price like from the  all right  it’s a price from the   they are being hurt very badly  i think they’re going to settle their dispute pretty quickly    why — on the oil why do you think you haven’t been more successful on getting them to raise the price the president  go ahead please    why — why do you think you haven’t been more successful in getting them to increase production in russia and saudi arabia if inaudible the president  well they have increased production  that’s what they’ve done  they’ve increased it so much that there’s so — you meant the opposite the president  i meant — yeah  why do you think you haven’t been successful in inaudible increase production the president  yeah  look look just so — well they’re going to stop because the market  ultimately the market is going to get them to stop  but they both did the opposite  they increased production to a level that water is right now more valuable than oil  who would have ever thought right    you have relationships with — the president  you go to — you go to some of these kingdoms water is far more valuable than oil  there’s so much oil  it’s a tribute in a way    inaudible the president  but what happened is there was a lot to start off with and then you had the virus and it knocked the hell out of the market it — in terms of demand  so there’s no demand and there’s tremendous supply so i mean you saw numbers where it was down to  and down frankly below   it was even below   it’s an incredible thing the market  but ultimately the marketplace will take care of it  but i think they’re going to work out their problem fairly quickly okay go ahead    mr president — thank you mr president  we’re already talking about phase four of a stimulus right  but you and pelosi and mcconnell are already talking about different things that should be in it  now last time people were telling me that the fact that you wouldn’t talk to pelosi was an impediment and it really slowed things down  are you — the president  i’d talk — if it were important to talk to her i’d talk to her    are you going to talk to her during the — the president  if it were important for the american people i’d talk to her  but other than that i can have other people talking to her look you ready  infrastructure is a great thing for me  i think infrastructure for this country — we have an old broken infrastructure  fifty years ago we were the envy of the world  and then we spent all this money so stupidly in the middle east  we spent — it’s going to be very close to  trillion in the middle east  how stupid was that decision  but they spent it on that and other things we’ve got to fix our infrastructure    but pelosi is already downplaying — the president  that means roads highways tunnels airports everything  we got to fix our infra —    but pelosi is already kind of downplaying — the president  and the beauty is because of the fact that we are so strong as a country we’re borrowing at zero  we never had a chance to borrow at zero  even in this country we’d never had a chance to borrow at zero  we’re going borrow — this is a great time so we can fix our infrastructure and we’ll have almost no interest costs  this is the time to do it steve one more question    the death total projection that you shared with us earlier this week are we still on the current trajectory for that  or have social distancing — the president  which trajec — which one  i have many trajectories for many things    the  —  to   to   are we still on that trajectory or have we made any improvements  or maybe not enough time has passed the president  say — say it  say it steve  what    have we made enough improvements the president  on what  on what    on social distancing    have the models changed  have the models changed the president  i’d have to ask dr fauci and i’d have — have to ask deborah  have the models changed dr birx  so a lot of the projections you can see are based on — there’s many different ways to look at this  and as we discussed on sunday some of it is based on the current global experience  we are about i think  or  times the size of italy a different factor in spain  and we look at all of those — what their projections are where they are currently and where that is going  and so a lot of the work is based on how this virus has moved through other populations  that’s a very direct way to see how the virus is impacting a population there’s also terrific models  and so every day and every night one of the models that actually looks at the model related to mortality is the healthdataorg data  and they update it every night and you can see where we are in that projection  i think in the last run of that model they were at  or something in the model now all of that can be changed by our behaviors  and so — and all of it can be changed in a different way if we don’t follow those behaviors  if another major metropolitan area ends up having an epidemic like the new york metro area that could dramatically change not the model but the reality of the impact of this virus on americans    and where are the models on — the president  and by the way the models show hundreds of thousands of people are going to die  you know what i want to do  i want to come away under the models  the professionals did the models  i was never involved in a model but — at least this kind of a model  but you know what  hundreds of thousands of people they say are going to die  i want much less than that  i want none but it’s too late for that  but i want very few people relative to what the models are saying those are projections  i hope they’re wrong  i hope we’re going to be under those projections    mr president two questions on continuity of government  for — the president  how come you always have two  why can’t you have one    well they’re related the president  every time “i have three questions  i have two questions  can you give me one instead  because we have a couple of other people  go ahead    okay i’ll go with my second one  the governor of wisconsin is now talking about delaying the primary at least not having inperson voting  so my question is — and i asked this a couple weeks ago i want to see if you’ve made any progress on this  looking ahead to the fall are you taking steps to ensure that the general election will happen even if this pandemic has reemerged or hasn’t gone away  and — the president  the general election will happen on november     and do you — are you — the president  in wisconsin what happened is i through social media — media put out a very strong endorsement of a republican conservative judge who’s an excellent brilliant judge  he’s a justice and i hear what happened is his poll numbers went through the roof  and because of that i think they delayed the election    you don’t think the governor is concerned about people going to inperson voting the president  i don’t know  why didn’t he do it before  he was doing right before the election    but do you think every — the president  excuse me  why didn’t he do this two weeks ago  all of a sudden —    but isn’t it — because of the pandemic the president  excuse me  all of a sudden an election which is taking place very soon gets delayed  now i just endorsed him today and it was a very strong endorsement  his polls — he’s gone very high up  and all of a sudden the governor comes out — the democrat governor by the way — comes out and says “oh we’re going to move this election  so i don’t know  i’m sure — i hope you’re right  i hope you’re right    but — but do you think every state in this country should be prepared for mailin voting in case we’re in a situation — the president  no because i think a lot of people cheat with mailin voting  i think people should vote with id — voter id  i think voter id is very important  and the reason they don’t want voter id is because they intend to cheat when you get something when you buy something you look at your cards and credit cards and different cards — you have your picture on many of them  not all of them but on many of them  you should have a picture on your — on your — for voting  it should be called “voter id  they should have that  and it shouldn’t be mailin —    but how are you going to — the president  excuse me  it shouldn’t be mailin voting  it should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself  you don’t send it in the mail where people pick up — all sorts of bad things can happen by the time they signed that if they sign that — if they signed that by the time it gets in and is tabulated no it shouldn’t be mailed in  you should vote at the booth  and you should have voter id because when you have voter id that’s the real deal thank you very much  we’ll see you tomorrow en            pm edt

a great honor to be with the world leaders in american oil and gas and really i could say the world leaders period when it comes to energy and american energy  the biggest companies anywhere — anywhere in the world i want to thank secretary of the interior david bernhardt secretary of energy dan brouillette and ambassador robert lighthizer for being here we’re also joined by leader kevin mccarthy senators john cornyn kevin cramer ted cruz and dan sullivan  thank you  these are people that really want to see good energy at the good price with us as well are greg garland of phillips  dave hager of devon energy harold hamm of continental resources jeff hildebrand of hilcorp energy vicki hollub of occidental petroleum mike sommers of the american petroleum institute kelcy warren of energy transfer partners mike wirth of chevron and darren woods of an extremely small company known as exxon mobil  well it’s smaller today than it was four weeks ago — laughter — by about half right  that’s all right  it’ll be better than ever today we’ll discuss the impact of the coronavirus on american energy industry  as the pandemic brought on by global economy — i mean it’s an incredible thing that’s happened  nobody thought this was possible  we had the greatest economy in the world  probably you were doing — all of you — the best ever  everybody was doing the best ever  and then all of a sudden they said “you have to shut down the country” and they have to shut down the world because the whole world is shut down not the country  the whole world is shut down  countries  probably it’s higher than that now  that was as of a week ago so the entire world is shut down trying to get rid of this scourge  and — and we’ll do it i thought what i might do is go around the room and you just introduce yourselves to the media real quickly and then we’ll have a discussion afterwards  you know our  relief package includes provisions to allow businesses to deduct their losses this year against taxes they paid in previous years which gets you a lot of liquidity  and a lot of companies need the liquidity right now and hopefully we’re going to be back in business very soon  we’re going to be open very soon  this country wasn’t built to be closed  and essentially we have a closed country  nobody has ever heard of a thing like this but this was — i was with some of the leading professionals and they say not since  has there been anything like this   was a time when i guess you could say   or  million — you hear different estimates — people died  think of that  million  maybe  million people died  so they had no communications  they weren’t able to shut things down like we are doing but that was a — that was a plague  that was a plague  it started here actually  it went to europe  we were badly affected but europe was really affected  so that was the worst so not since  years ago — more than  years ago has this — a thing like this happened i just want to start by saying it’s an honor to be with you  i know most of you one way or the other  some of you i know and — but i know all of you by seeing you on the covers of all the business magazines and the magazines  and you’ve done a great job and we’ll work this out and we’ll get our energy business back  i’m with you  percent  it’s a great business  it’s a very vital business  and honestly you’ve been very fair  you’ve kept energy prices reasonable for a long period of time  we’ve got a long period of time with very reasonable energy prices so i want to thank you all for being here  and maybe we’ll start with mike  please mr wirth  all right  mike wirth with chevron corporation mr president  i’m proud of the work our people are doing to support healthcare providers first responders and all the other vital industries that keep our economy going thank you for having us the president  thank you mike very much  appreciate it ms hollub  vicki hollub of occidental petroleum the president  hi

you for your great leadership through this pandemic crisis and all that you’ve done on the stimulus package really for the american economy  i’m proud of our employees  they’re working to provide energy and improve lives the president  we think it’s going to come back quickly  it’s — it’s ready  we’re ready  and we’ve got the right packages out there  so — mr garland  we need it too the president  very good  we’re looking at a — i think we’re going to be really looking very seriously at a infrastructure package where — it’s so important for our country you know as of this moment darren we have  trillionplus in the middle east  for what  for what reason  and we don’t put money in our own country  so we’re going to do a big — a big package on infrastructure fairly soon i think and that’s very important  and it’s great for you great for everybody darren please mr woods  thank you mr president  darren woods exxon mobil corporation  i’d like to add my thanks for your leadership in this space as well and say i think all of our companies here align with your objective which is to get the economy moving and to make people’s lives around the world better the president  good  great job you’ve done  thank you mr hamm  harold hamm chairman of continental resources also out of oklahoma city  thanks for having this meeting  i think this is so timely and necessary  really appreciate your leadership also the friendship that you’ve kept with the saudis — the saudi crown minister — or crown prince and also vladimir putin  i know those haven’t been easy sometimes but at this time it was particularly needed so i represent our company as well as depa — domestic energy producers alliance  and we’re about  companies and individuals — mostly independent producers the president  that’s great  great job you’re doing i think president putin and the crown prince want something to happen badly  certainly terrible for them what’s happening too  so they want to see something happen  i’ve spoken to both of them and we’ll tell you about that in a little while  okay thank you very much mr hildebrand  thank you mr president  jeff hildebrand founder and chairman hilcorp energy  our distinction is we are the only private company here  this is a company that’s based in houston domesticonly exploration and production company and i’m really here today to represent the independent energy companies the familyowned businesses that are in this industry and to give you really that perspective and add to the conversation in that regard the president  good  that’s great mr hildebrand  so thank you for your leadership the president  thank you mr hildebrand  appreciate it the president  great job  thank you mr hildebrand  you bet mr warren  thank you mr president  kelcy warren energy transfer  we’re the only pipeline company  and so we try to do business with everybody in this room and i think we successfully do actually  so it’s an honor to be here sir and it’s an honor to be in this room with these folks as well the president  and everyone loves that guy right  we all do  thank you very much kelcy  great  great job you’re doing too he’s not an oil and gas man  he’s a wonderful person and a wonderful politician and he wants to see the industry get strong again  so kevin do you have anything to say by the way leader mccarthy  well first i want to thank you for doing this  just by you reaching out to president putin and the crown prince things have improved  you’re looking around at a lot of jobs but what else you’re not seeing at this table a lot of these are small businesses that work with all these individuals around here  and your action today with signing the cares act getting the smallbusiness loans out is going very strongly — the president  yeah leader mccarthy  — because it’s needed the president  it’s doing well leader mccarthy  but the american economy — the greatest strength is our — what energy provides us  you provide us at a good price  these are great jobs  but more importantly it also gives us energy independence  it changes the whole dynamics around the world and so i thank you for the leadership and what you’re doing the president  thank you kevin  and as you just said the bank of america in particular has really — of the big banks — has really stepped into it  they have done a fantastic job  today it’s over — leader mccarthy  ten thousand in the first two hours the president  yeah  bank of america has been unbelievable  and i want to thank them  i want to thank all of the community banks and the smaller banks that have been loaning a lot of money — paycheck  it’s all about the paycheck  and that — nobody would have believed it could have gone so well so it’s — it’s just a number of hours  but the numbers are far greater than we would have anticipated  so it’s been really great and thank you to all the banks but again in particular bank of america  they really stepped right up and they did it  there were no big deals  they weren’t making a big deal out of anything  so that was terrific and i think what we want to do — john cornyn please  i know how you are so involved in this coming from the great state of texas  would you like to say a couple of words john senator cornyn  thank you mr president  thank you for convening the meeting  many of us have been talking together but we can’t get done what needs to be done  only you and the administration can  and particularly getting the attention of the saudis and flooding the markets really adding insult to injury in a time when on our economy was suffering anyway because of the coronavirus  and so this meeting could not be more timely i agree with what’s been said about the importance of affordable energy to our standard of living  and really we’ve changed the — changed the world as a result of the production of domestic energy here and improved the quality of life for a lot of people the president  thanks very much john  really good job  and john agrees — we were talking about it the other day — that you’ve all done well but you’ve also kept energy very affordable really  very very affordable and very — a lot of it  we never had any problems  and we’re going to keep it that way do i see dan back there  dan senator sullivan  yes sir mr president  laughter the president  i was looking — i thought that looked like dan senator sullivan  i want to thank you for convening this meeting  you know under the trump administration working with the congress the us has become the world’s energy superpower again  it’s unbelievable  and these companies have done it  obviously it’s a very important issue in my state the great state of alaska  but these are great jobs as john cornyn just said for all of our states  but it’s really important for the national security of our country too and we have been — a number of senators have been reaching out having frank discussions with the saudis saying “hey if you’re a longstanding ally of ours we’re not — right now you’re hurting a lot of our citizens  you’re hurting a lot of the people we represent and shouldn’t take us for granted” we have a great military that’s protected saudi arabia for decades  and senator cramer and i have some legislation that could possibly change that if they don’t start cooperating so again we appreciate your leadership with the crown prince with the russians in calling this meeting but this is a great sector of the us economy that once we get through this and we will — of this pandemic this –this sector is going to take off again  and your — your administration and you have had a lot to do with the strength of the us energy sector  and we need to keep it strong the president  thank you very much dan and kevin cramer north dakota  people don’t realize how big a producer north dakota is  right senator cramer  well harold knows  laughter senator cornyn  harold knows senator cramer  it sort of allows the others inaudible the president  harold — harold knows that’s for sure senator cramer  mr president to echo everything and maybe add a little bit the people around your cabinet table right now are part of the renaissance of oil and gas in this country  but since you became president we went from a renaissance to security to independence to dominance  and that dominance and that security are — right now are in some danger just a quick example in north dakota since saudi arabia and russia announced their little price war we’ve had  billion of cutbacks taken out of our state planned for this year the president  yeah senator cramer  i was economic development director when the entire gross domestic product of north dakota was  billion  so that’s significant  that represents not just capex that represents lots of jobs lots of people in the value chain and i would just add one word to what dan talked about with regard to saudi arabia  it is estimated by one report in  that we spent a minimum of  billion defending global oil supplies  we can use that money in national defense and other hotspots in the world if our friends are going to treat us this way so i appreciate your outreach this week  i think we’re halfway there just with the success of your diplomacy this week  thank you for this meeting the president  well it’s gone up  it’s gone up  and we have to  otherwise we do — we lose a lot of jobs too  we’re talking about one of the big job producers anywhere kevin right would you have anything to say mr sommers  mr president thank you  i’m mike sommers  i’m president and ceo of the american petroleum institute  the folks around this table represent the american energy revolution and we want to thank you for everything that you’ve done to support that revolution  and we want to make sure that revolution continues — the president  right mr sommers  — after this pandemic crisis is solved the president  thank you mike mr sommers  thank you sir the president  thank you  very good leader mccarthy  i think senator cruz was somewhere — the president  i think he’s around here leader mccarthy  right back there  ted can’t be seen the president  where — where is senator cruz participant  he’s hiding behind the press  laughter the president  i can’t believe it  he’s gone — he’s gone over to the evil side  laughter  that’s terrible cruz what are you doing there senator cruz  mr president thank you for convening this meeting  this is an important meeting and this is the time as you know of crisis all across the country — a public health crisis and an economic crisis as you’ve heard and as you know from everyone around this table the energy sector has been a huge part of the economic success and boom that we’ve enjoyed over the last several years  and the combination of the economic harm of the coronavirus crisis combined with the saudis and russians waging economic warfare on jobs in this country it’s been a perfect storm in the energy sector and i’ll tell you there are a lot of jobs — there are millions of jobs in texas and across the country that are represented by the men and women around this table and by energy producers  and there are small producers throughout texas and throughout the country who are — who are on the verge of being driven out of business and so this — this meeting i think is important  every one of the senators in this room has had multiple conversations with the saudis leaning in hard on the saudis  and your leadership and diplomacy with the crown prince had a big impact getting them to stop flooding the market and taking advantage of this crisis and i would underscore one other issue that a number of the folks around this table have raised and i’m very concerned about is ensuring that those in energy in this time of crisis have access to capital  that — there are jobs that are hanging in the balance  and if the energy producers in this country that have made america the number one producer of oil and gas in the world can’t access capital to get out of this crisis we’re going to see bankruptcies at a level this country hasn’t seen in decades and so this meeting and the continued leadership of your administration is hugely important  thank you the president  good  thank you very much ted  and while you’re up the concept and for instance — i think we should say it in front of the media — but oil reserves storing oil  we’re filling up the national reserves as you know  we’re getting the oil at a great price but at these prices — in fact kevin and i have been speaking about it john and i have been speaking about it — at these prices you would think you’d want to fill up every cavity that we have in this country  and there’s some areas in louisiana and other areas that could be filled up they hold a lot of oil but at these prices — and it would be good and it would keep everybody working — but you would think you’d want to fill up those areas  what do you think of that ted senator cruz  look i think that’s exactly right  i think it makes sense in terms of easing the pressure that is threatening these jobs  but it also makes sense for the taxpayer the president  yeah senator cruz  that strategic petroleum reserve is there in times of crisis  and usually the way the federal government works is we buy when it’s expensive and we sell when it’s cheap the president  yeah  no it’s — senator cruz  we actually have an opportunity now to buy when it’s cheap  i think it was inexcusable that democratic leadership in the house and senate blocked that in this bill we passed last week  and then i think congress needs to go back and address it leader mccarthy  it was in the bill senator cruz  yep leader mccarthy  and then the speaker came in and that’s the one thing — when she held this bill up for the number of days — that she removed the president  twentydollar oil  think of it leader mccarthy  yeah the president  twenty dollars senator cruz  well and there are too many democrats — the president  it’s politics senator cruz  — that want to see these — the president  it’s all right senator cruz  — jobs go away the president  i think you should go back though kevin  i think you should go back and see john if you guys can go back and do a separate bill and beyond that you know i think it’s  million barrels right now to fill it up  that’s not that much  so it’s fairly in pretty good shape  but we have other areas that are bigger frankly that we can fill up too but at those prices we should be — we should be pumping it out  so maybe you guys can check on it and see what you can do about it  i don’t think anyone can reject it  nobody can reject it  ted you’ll work on that senator cruz  absolutely the president  anybody else  david you guys okay  david you want to say something secretary bernhardt  so just one thing mr president  the department of the interior manages a large portion of land and part of the offshore  and one of the things we have done over the last  days as you had the “slow the spread” we have really had our inspectors out on the frontlines working to make sure that the production that’s taking place is occurring in a safe and a responsible manner and i thank everybody for their cooperation in that these jobs are so important to the american people and it’s important that we make sure that we dot our i’s and cross our t’s too the president  he’s the biggest landlord in the country  laughter  meaning it’s called interior  interior is a lot of land when you look at it  thank you  great job you’re doing so dan go ahead secretary brouillette  mr president thank you  thank you sir for your leadership the president  thank you dan secretary brouillette  my name is dan brouillette  i serve the president as the secretary of energy  with regard to the storage mr president i’m happy to announce we went to market this week for  million barrels  notwithstanding the — the desire of the congress not to give us new money to pursue this idea we have found an alternative financing mechanism — the president  good secretary brouillette  — so that we can immediately find — the president  i figured you would  laughter  i actually wasn’t worried about it  laughter secretary brouillette  — so that can we can find — the president  what are you paying per barrel secretary brouillette  i’m sorry sir the president  what are you paying  laughs  he didn’t want to answer secretary brouillette  it’s going to be a little a low  laughter the president  what are you paying per barrel  a flexible price or would it – secretary brouillette  they may be paying us  this could be a little low the president  so we’re going to go negative like interests rates  negative secretary brouillette  but mr president i just wanted you to know — and for the industry players who are here we are moving very aggressively  we’re using every tool that we have at the us department of energy not only to provide immediate relief for this particular industry and the economy itself but also to look for technologies that over time will reduce the cost structure for the entire industry so we’re moving as aggressively as we can sir  thank you for your leadership the president  dan check out other areas where you can store oil secretary brouillette  yes sir the president  and there are some very big ones bigger than what we have now  and at these prices you should do it secretary brouillette  yes sir the president  refill it up right secretary brouillette  yes sir the president  fill up the tank okay bob lighthizer you’ve been so great  and this isn’t your meeting really but bob has done some of the best trade deals ever done in our country  and one of them has kicked — it actually kicked in on april  and that’s with china  and i hope they’re buying a lot  i hope ambassador lighthizer  i don’t inaudible say anything the president  want to say something ambassador lighthizer  i’m here to answer questions mr president so i’ll just — i’ll just keep my mouth shut  but the trade deals are working  china is good  we’re on — we’re on track with usmca  but i’ll just answer questions the president  he’s very shy  that’s good  he just wants to make deals  that’s all  and you’ve done a great job  thank you very much we will have a news conference at about  o’clock  maybe  and so we’ll see you in a little while  we’ll answer questions but this is a great group of leaders and we’ve got to make sure that we preserve and even make greater our energy industry  and i want to thank all of the senators and congressmen the boss here for being here and for working so hard  they are — i’ll tell you what they are calling me constantly  they want your industry to be successful and they really — and they’re going to make it that way  we’re all going to make it that way so i’ll see you at  o’clock and — same place  we look forward to it  thank you  thank you very much    one question about testing  was anybody in here tested

are up to  percent forgivable as long as employers keep paying their workers  got to take care of your workers furthermore we want social security beneficiaries to know that if they are typically not required to file a tax return they don’t have to file one in order to receive the direct cash payments that will soon be distributed to american citizens  the treasury will deposit the money directly into the bank accounts  and don’t forget i will always protect your social security your medicare and your medicaid  we’re protecting social security medicare and medicaid and i always will i’d like now to invite sba administrator jovita carranza who’s doing a fantastic job — she’s going to be very busy in the next little while — and secretary steve mnuchin to say a few words about these vital initiatives  and then we’ll get on to the attack of the virus itself and please if i might steve and jovita administrator carranza  thank you  thank you mr president and mr vice president secretary mnuchin ivanka trump and all who i have been working closely with in this effort  small business is the backbone of the american economy and the president has put the nation’s  million small businesses front and center in the response effort and we are working hard to get money to them quickly this is an unprecedented effort by this administration to support small businesses and we know that there will be challenges in the process  secretary mnuchin and i are working in tandem to ensure that feedback from our partners is being heard and implemented the private and public sector must work closely together to ensure that small businesses and their workers across the country are put first  this administration believes wholeheartedly that if you are a small business you are a critical part of the economic fabric of this country  and your viability is critical to the economic wellbeing of your employees at sba we are working around the clock to support small businesses ensuring that we are prioritizing emergency capital for small businesses that are suffering economic harm as a result of this unprecedented situation this relief will help stabilize a small business sector by providing businesses with the financial resources they need to keep their workers employed and keep up with their daytoday operating expenses today i want to ensure that small businesses all over the country know about the paycheck protection program and how they can benefit from this  simply put the paycheck protection program is to help keep employees on payroll and small businesses open  sba will forgive the portion of the loan that is used toward job retention and certain other expenses  we are working closely with lenders so that businesses can go directly to their local lenders the paycheck protection program is in addition to substantial work that the sba has and will continue to do to help small businesses including providing advances on sba disaster loans and forgiving existing sba loan payments over the next six months additional details on these critically important programs can be found at sbagov  and we will be updating these resources regularly our hearts go out to those affected by this terrible virus  our communities around the country are stepping up and we will get through this together at sba we know that every phone call email or application submitted has a smallbusiness owner their employees and the communities they support around the other side  our most important objective is to allow small businesses to keep their employees onboard and keep their businesses viable through this unprecedented disruption i want to reiterate the importance of patience in this process as we work together to ensure that businesses are able to access needed credit  we will continue working around the clock as we’ve done with our federal and private sector partners expanding capacity and working to make our systems as robust as possible to meet the needs thank you mr president the president  thank you jovita  very good  thank you secretary mnuchin  thank you mr president thank you mr vice president and thank you jovita  mr president you’ve made it clear to us we now need to execute  we need to get money to small business and american workers and that’s what we’re doing the sba and treasury committed to get this program up and running tomorrow  and when jovita says people are working around the clock they literally — we had both teams working until  o’clock in the morning and start working again today we’ve heard feedback from lenders community banks regional banks and we spent the last  hours making this system even easier so this will be up and running tomorrow  i encourage all small businesses that have  or fewer people please contact your lenders  any fdic institution will be able to do this any credit union existing sba lenders and fintech lenders you get the money  you’ll get it the same day  you use this to pay your workers  please bring your workers back to work  if you’ve let them go you have eight weeks plus overhead  this is a very important program i’m pleased to announce we are going to raise the interest rate on these loans — and again the interest rate is paid for as part of the program the borrower doesn’t have to pay this — to  percent  we had announced it was going to be  basis points  we’ve heard from some smaller community banks that their deposit costs — even though the government is borrowing at three or four basis points — this is on average a  loan  to make this attractive for community banks we’ve agreed to raise the interest rate again i encourage everybody take out the paycheck protection program i’m also pleased to report the economic impact payments  i had previously said this would take us three weeks  i’m pleased to report that within two weeks the first payments will be direct deposit into taxpayers’ account and as the president said last night the president authorized me to say that anybody that has social security recipients won’t need to file a new tax return and we’ll have that  if we don’t have your direct deposit information we’ll be putting up a web portal so that you can put that up  it is a very large priority  the president has made clear we want to get this money quickly into your hands i’m also pleased to report that we continue to work closely with the federal reserve  we’re in the process of designing a new facility that we call the “main street” lending facility  we’re also looking at facilities for state governments as well and i’m also pleased to report the employee retention credit — it’s up and running  the first  of wages you get a  percent credit that’s  per person  for everyone who’s kept someone you can immediately get that money you can deduct it from what you owe the irs immediately  if you don’t owe us money you’ll get a refundable tax credit  so that is up and running i’m also pleased to report we have the program up and running  we’re taking applications from the airlines from the cargo companies and from national security companies so thank you very much mr president the president  thank you steve  for jovita or steve any questions please    mr secretary chase bank sent a letter to its business clients today saying that they don’t have the necessary guidance from the sba from the treasury department to be able to accept loan applications starting tomorrow  the need is clearly enormous  but at least one major bank says they’re not fully empowered yet to be able to help their customers secretary mnuchin  well as i spoke to all the ceos yesterday — i had a conference call with them — we got very good input from them on what they needed  as i said people were working until  o’clock i believe we just put up the federal register with the new guidelines for lenders  i’ve been assured that the banks will be in the process starting tomorrow now again it’s going to take a little bit of time but we committed that this will be available tomorrow and i encourage all companies go to sbacom sbagov go to treasurygov  you can see the information you need immediately    just to follow up with the smallbusiness owners  a number of them are saying that they were on that conference call and that there’s a tremendous power struggle going on between the treasury and sba and that it’s over process and forms is what they tell me that lenders are actually opting out because they can’t make enough money to even service the loans  so how are you going to make sure these smallbusiness owners get the capital they need to survive right now secretary mnuchin  well first of all i can assure you — jovita is here  jovita used to work for me as the treasurer  there is no power struggle administrator carranza  no secretary mnuchin  jovita and our team as i said worked together until  o’clock in the morning and started working at  o’clock again  we’ve made the form simpler and i can assure you at five points — i’ve told these bankers they should take all their traders and put them in the branches  there’ll never be another opportunity to earn five points on a  government — fully governmentguaranteed loan    and those checks right into direct deposit the irs now saying it would take four to five months you’re saying two weeks  can you give us a solid — secretary mnuchin  well let me be — let me be clear  i don’t know where you’re hearing these things  i told you this would be three weeks  i’m not committing to two weeks  we’re delivering on our commitments the irs which i oversee within two weeks the first money will be in people’s accounts    just to follow up on that i think the question is not about the first checks  for folks who have direct deposit it sounds like those will go out pretty quickly  the question is then for folks who don’t have direct deposit secretary mnuchin  sure    and there was a staff memo that was released by the house ways and means committee today saying that that process could take up to five weeks sic  that takes you to midaugust  is that how long it’s going to take secretary mnuchin  that is not going to take five —    or five months i’m sorry secretary mnuchin  again let me just say when obama sent out these checks it took months and months and months  i am assuring the american public  they need the money now  what we’re going to do is — again if we have your information you’ll get it in two — in — within two weeks  social security you’ll get it very quickly after that  if we don’t have your information you’ll have a simple web portal you’ll upload it  if we don’t have that we’ll send you checks in the mail    how many checks can you process in a week though  how many checks can you — secretary mnuchin  again we can process a lot of checks but we don’t want to send checks  in this environment we don’t want people to get checks  we want to put money directly into their account    thank you mr secretary  this is for i guess both you and the administrator  there have been some anecdotal reports that business people are trying to get access to the online site to submit the applications  the website has been crashing  i’ve heard of webinars going offline because there’s just too many people on them  so how are you guys going to be ready you know tomorrow to get these loans out secretary mnuchin  we’ve brought in a lot of external resources at sba and us to make sure there’s additional capacity  as i said we heard a lot of good feedback yesterday to simplify this process  it’s going to be up and running now let me just be clear that doesn’t mean everybody is going to get their loan tomorrow  but the system will be up and running  we encourage people over the next week sign up  you can go on right now  you can go on the web see what information you need  very simple process    mr secretary on a separate subject have you been in touch with leader mcconnell and speaker pelosi about their differences right now about another stimulus package secretary mnuchin  i spoke to — i’ve spoken to the leader i’ve spoken to the speaker  i’ve spoken to the president constantly  when the president is ready and thinks we should do the next stage we’re ready  the president has talked about the issue of infrastructure since the campaign  i think you know that’s a big priority for him and again if we run out of money on the smallbusiness program we’ll be back right away to congress to get this increased    does the unemployment numbers today increase the urgency of doing a phase four secretary mnuchin  well let me just say you know we’re going through something that we’ve never done before where the government has shut down big parts of the economy because of health reasons  our economy was in great shape our companies were in great shape there are three ways that americans are going to be protected for small business they’ll get paid by their business through this program  the direct deposit  there’s also enhanced unemployment so we realized unfortunately there are a lot of companies that because they aren’t in business over a short period of time — again we’re working with the states on enhanced unemployment and as soon as the medical professionals and the president give the all clear we’re going to have a ton of liquidity  we have about  trillion — this has never been done between us and the fed — to put into the economy to support american workers and american business    mr secretary in addition to the jobless numbers we saw today phase three was signed before the social distancing guidelines were extended for another month  so what additional relief are you going to give to americans as they stay out of work for all these extra weeks  i mean what are you waiting for secretary mnuchin  well we — in designing this program we thought that we had liquidity for about  weeks  and that’s what we’ve designed and again i think the president’s been very clear if we need to go back to congress to support the american economy and american workers we will be doing that     secretary mnuchin house speaker nancy pelosi has formed a select committee to oversee the distribution of recovery funds  and she says she wants to make sure that those funds are wisely and efficiently spent  do you think that select committee is something that’s necessary secretary mnuchin  i don’t  i mean you know the — both parties wanted us to have oversight wanted us to have transparency  we have full transparency  we have a oversight committee that the speaker gets to pick someone the leader gets to pick someone  i believe there’s five people on it  and again that committee will review the money that we’re spending  and again we support full transparency  taxpayers should understand how we’re going to support this economy and jobs    mr secretary senator murkowski has asked you to consider providing loans to energy companies under the cares act the phase three bill  what are your thoughts on that  would you consider providing those loans to energy companies secretary mnuchin  so thank you and let me clarify  i have very limited ability to do direct loans out of the treasury  i can do them for passenger airlines cargo airlines contractors and national security companies  outside of that we work with the federal reserve to create broadbased lending facilities which we will do so so our expectation is the energy companies like all our other companies will be able to participate in broadbased facilities whether it’s the corporate facility or whether it’s the “main street” facility but not direct lending out of the treasury    a question for clarity about the direct payments to americans  for those folks who don’t have bank accounts who don’t have direct deposit information on file with the irs how long would they have to wait for their check secretary mnuchin  well for people who don’t have direct deposit — again we’ll have an easy way they put it up  we can on a rolling basis — i think you know within a couple of days when they give it to us we’ll send the money out  we do realize there are people who are underbanked and again we’re working with all the digital companies prepaid debit cards  we’re working with all of them to make sure we have a process that every american gets their money quickly  this money does people no good if it shows up in four months  and we will deliver on that promise    so “quickly” is a matter of weeks then perhaps not months secretary mnuchin  “quickly” is a matter of weeks and not months  that’s correct    mr secretary would you consider a moratorium — secretary mnuchin  in the back  go ahead    mr secretary one area where you can make direct loans is to the airlines  how much do you expect that the treasury department and the federal government will be involved in overseeing the operations of airlines as it pertains to which routes get cut back how much they operate what they do about their employees and the like secretary mnuchin  so there are — there are very strict requirements that’s built into the bill  again this was a bipartisan requirement  one anything we do with the airlines they have to maintain substantially all of their employees  so again any money that we provide them will go to pay their employees  we’re going to be working with the secretary of transportation  there are requirements to maintain certain routes so again we have a very clear process  we’ve hired three outside advisors who will be financial advisors and three law firms  we’ll be releasing that information shortly  and i want to thank them  they’re all working for basically very very little money  they couldn’t work for free so they’ve agreed to basically work for what they would sign up to work for charitable organizations so again no big fees to bankers  we’ve got a great team of three lawyers and three financial advisors that will assist us    mr secretary just to follow up on that will you give us a list of the names of those people who are advising you when you release the information secretary mnuchin  of course we will  we’ll give you the names as well as the contracts  so again —    do you have any names right now other than blackrock secretary mnuchin  so again i’m happy to announce we have — the pjt partners — okay — is going to do the passenger airlines moelis  company is going to do the cargo and contractors and perella weinberg will handle the national security  and there’ll be three law firms which we’ll announce shortly that will be working in each one of those sectors and again let me just be clear we need to get this done quickly  the airlines need money  we’re going to work very closely with the department of transportation and get this done quickly  we’ve actually already received contracts from a lot of the people  again there’s guidance up on the web  full transparency  we’ve asked for applications    mr secretary on the airline issue again you know speaker pelosi and others have said that the government taking stakes in those airlines should not be a condition for the federal government to provide payroll support specifically  what’s your response to that secretary mnuchin  i spoke to the speaker last night about that  this was something that was highly negotiated between the republicans and the democrats  the president was personally involved in this  he was on the phone with us many times  mitch mcconnell mark meadows senators on both sides there is a specific line in the bill that says that the secretary meaning me will determine proper compensation  so this is not a bailout for the airlines  and i will be working — once we get our advice from our financial advisors we get the applications from the airlines i’ll be working very closely with the president and we’ll make sure that we strike the right balance not a bailout  taxpayers get compensated  but these airlines — these are national security issues  we want to keep our airlines intact    mr secretary just more broadly for — perhaps for the administrator if not for you as well  some small businesses restaurant owners for example are finding that laying off their employees so that they can start collecting unemployment is better both for them as business owners and for their workers  what incentives do they have right now to keep their employees on the payroll if no one is coming into their restaurant secretary mnuchin  well the incentive that you have — and we want american business to be kept intact  the incentive is these are loans that turn into grants  so if you’re a business owner and you’re a restaurant you can hire your people back you get money for their medical  you keep them on the medical plan  you get money for your rent  you get money for your electricity  so you’re motivated  we want you to have a business that you can reopen quickly when it’s appropriate  so this doesn’t cost the business owners anything you know when people talk about — i can’t imagine any american worker who had a job has offered to keep their job isn’t going to want to have it  and let me just be clear — we’ve also talked about this unemployment issue  you can only get unemployment if you don’t have a job  so unemployment is intended for those people that are some of the midsize or larger businesses — and we’re very sympathetic to this — that these companies can’t afford  and for those people the enhanced unemployment will be a significant benefit but we want to make sure —  percent of the american workforce is small businesses under  people  the president the vice president the administrator and i want to make sure this part of the economy is ready and intact when we’re ready to reopen    a question for the administrator if i may  is there a certain category of small businesses that you’re most concerned about  restaurants hair salons things like that administrator carranza  that’s a great question  we’re concerned about every small business  there’s  million small businesses that we’re really focused on  and we’re working feverishly to make sure that we can provide the available funds to them as quickly as possible so it’s  million small businesses and the other businesses are being dealt with with the ppp with the paycheck protection  there was also the disaster — what we call it the injury — or economic injury disaster loan  and then there was an advance associated with that particular program as well so to answer your question we’re concerned about all businesses  and as the secretary indicated we’re looking at employees being ready not lost in this process  we want businesses to stay intact because they represent half the — half the gdp  so if we spend a trillion to support  trillion or  trillion i think that’s a significant investment and that’s what we’re focused on    is there a certain segment that’s particularly vulnerable secretary mnuchin  let me — i just want to — hang on  i just want to make one comment for explanation because i want to make sure everybody out there understands this  if you’re an independent contractor if you’re a sole proprietor you’re eligible for this as well  now that program won’t be up and running until next week but again this is a very broad definition of small business  so if you’re an independent plumber if you’re an independent contractor you’re covered under this program  it’s slightly more complicated you have to come in to your bank and give them more information  but starting next week that part of the program will be up and running also charities  charities as well  very important  the vice president and president made sure that we covered small charities in this    and does that include churches and religious nonprofits secretary mnuchin  it does although there are some technical issues  but yes it does include faith organizations    is that under the under the — that’s under the sba program secretary mnuchin this is under the ppp  yes the new sba program they are covered the president  okay  thank you all very much secretary mnuchin  okay  thank you everybody the president  thank you jovita  thank you steve  great job  thank you okay so that begins right away and they start handing out checks  and a lot of people are going to have their businesses built back up quickly i hope  and we’ll see  it’s complicated big  small business is actually big business  so i thank them both and please — good  we have some great gentlemen  let me see  great gentlemen  that’s correct  thank you very much today my administration is also issuing new guidelines to protect elderly americans who remain the most vulnerable  by now nursing homes should have suspended the entry of all medically unnecessary personnel today we’re further recommending that all nursing home facilities assign the same staff to care for the same group of residents consistently to minimize any potential spread  and we’re also urging facilities to designate separate areas for healthy and sick residents  and this is a practice that we probably will be recommending into the future long after the enemy is gone — this particular enemy is gone we’re also making every effort to provide relief to our great veterans  we take very good care of our veterans  at my direction secretary wilkie will use any authority at his disposal to extend deadlines for benefits and to postpone debt collections we’re now conducting well over  coronavirus tests per day  it’s over a thou — a hundred thousand test a day –and these are accurate tests and they’re moving rapidly — which is more than any other country in the world both in terms of the raw number and also on a per capita basis  the most the fda has also authorized the first coronavirus antibody test developed by cellex a key step that will help identify people who have recovered and to understand their immune response and their immune system moments ago i directed secretary azar and acting secretary wolf to use any and all available authority under the defense production act to ensure that domestic manufacturers have the supplies they need to produce ventilators for patients with severe cases of covid   you know what that is right  become a very famous term covid — covid this action will help general electric hillrom medtronic resmed royal philips and vyaire medical overcome obstacles in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilators  we have over  being built right now or soon to be started  we anticipate issuing more orders under the defense production act in the very near future in addition to the one that i’ve just signed against  for facemasks — we just signed an element of the act against   and hopefully they’ll be able to do what they are supposed to do  i just spoke to mary barra of general motors and she said they’re very soon going to be ready to start production of the ventilators  they have a lot of ventilators that they’ve committed to build and they’ll be starting very very quickly fema continues to deliver resources to areas most affected by the virus including new york  on top of the  beds we’re already providing to the javits center the department of defense is adding another  icu beds governor cuomo has asked that this facility go — and it’s a big beautiful facility — it be converted to a covid hospital  and we hadn’t done that yet  we hadn’t thought in terms of doing that  but their use is — their real demand is for that  and we had meetings on it with the task force  we had meetings with the military  and i’ve decided to say “yes i’m going to do that” that i will be signing and agreeing to a “yes” answer so that — we will be doing that and also we will be staffing it  so the federal government is doing a lot of things that wasn’t anticipated that it do this is a  — andor  can easily be set up — hospital built in javits center  and so we’re going to be converting that to a  hospital  and it’s going to be staffed by the military and by the federal government and based on the fact that i agreed to that we had two other facilities that were likewise asking for it and that would be in louisiana and also in dallas  and we’ll be doing those  we spoke to the governor of louisiana spoke to the governor of texas  and we’ve told them that we will be staffing those hospitals again above and beyond but that’s okay  we have to do that in addition the usns comfort is docked in new york to accept patients  that is a noncovid to date fema has delivered more than  million  mask respirators  and it’s — think of that  million  four million don’t forget we’re a secondary source  the states are doing it and we’re backing them up  but we’ve gotten  million  respirators  million surgical masks  face shields  million gloves and  ventilators just to the city and to the state of new york  and some of them now are being sent  i spoke with both governor cuomo and mayor de blasio a little while ago and some of them are being sent to the city all of america stands with the people of new york in this time of need  it’s definitely a hotspot but we have other hotspots also  and we’re taking them — taking care of them very very strongly very powerfully  we have the finest people in the world in those locations  and i think the federal government has not only acted early but acted quickly professionally  there’s no people like this doctors nurses first responders and other healthcare providers who want to help new york at this critical time should visit website nycgovhelpnow  nycgovhelpnow  they need help now  they need people to help them we have great facilities and we’ve built some brandnew facilities big ones but we need help  we need help for professional people  so if you’re in an area that isn’t so affected and you’re a doctor a nurse a healthcare worker please get to that website  and we would really appreciate your help  new york city needs it  louisiana by the way needs it  michigan needs it  whatever you can do  those are very strong hotspots they need help in recent weeks as the virus has spread and economic hardship has followed we have seen americans unite with incredible selflessness and compassion  i want to remind everyone here in our nation’s capital especially in congress that this is not the time for politics endless partisan investigations here we go again  have already done extraordinary damage to our country in recent years  you see what happens  it’s witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt  and in the end the people doing the witch hunt have been losing and they’ve been losing by a lot  and it’s not any time for witch hunts  it’s time to get this enemy defeated conducting these partisan investigations in the middle of a pandemic is a really big waste of vital resources time attention  and we want to fight for american lives not waste time and build up my poll numbers because that’s all they’re doing because everyone knows it’s ridiculous so we want to focus on the people of this country even the people of the world — we’re going to be able to help them — because right now as an example we’re building so many ventilators — very very hard to build — but we’re building thousands  thousands of them  and a lot of them will be coming at a time when we won’t need them as badly because it takes time  very complex very expensive  and we’ll be able to help outside of our country  we think we’ll be able to help  that’s something that you cannot easily produce as citizens we’re linked together by the shared bonds of national love loyalty and affection  there’s no earthly force more powerful than the patriotic pride that stirs in our hearts  and that is so true  it’s incredible the job that everybody has been doing  everybody  they don’t sleep  they don’t go to bed  sometimes they get nothing i said to somebody recently on the task force “how many hours’ sleep have you gotten over the last couple of days  the answer was “none  none in one massachusetts neighborhood citizens come out of their homes each night at  o’clock from their porches and they sing “god bless america  others have joined in spreading from house to house down one street up to the next until their little town with a spirit of patriotism and reminding all americans that we’re all in this together  we’ll fight together and we will win together  we’re going to win this now what i’d like to do is — i’m going to step out  we have a meeting on this subject  and i’m going to step out just for a few moments  i’ll be right back  we’ll answer some questions but you have some very hardworking people who have done an incredible job led by vice president mike pence head of the task force  and then jared kushner is going to say a few words  and admiral polowczyk peter navarro dr birx and myself  i’ll be right back so i’ll see you in a little while i did take a test it just came out  this is from the white house physician  you may have it  it just came out  i just took it this morning  and i took it  it took me literally a minute to take it  and it took me i guess it was  or  minutes  i went to work  i didn’t wait for it but he said it took  minutes or something to come up with a conclusion  and it said “the president tested negative for   so that’s the second one i think i took it really out of curiosity to see how quickly it worked and fast it worked and it’s a lot easier  i’ve done them both  and the second one is much more pleasant jeff i can tell you that  much more pleasant so i’ll be back in a little while  and mike please take over  thank you  thank you all very much  i’ll be right back the vice president  thank you mr president  the white house coronavirus task force met today but earlier in the day the president convened all the key elements of our supply chain team in the oval office for an update on the progress that we have been making working literally around the clock to make sure that our healthcare workers the people on the frontlines have the personal protective equipment and also the ventilators to be able to meet this moment and today you’re going to hear from the people that are literally working — working each and every day to make that happen  dr deborah birx is also with us  she’ll reflect in a few moments on the progress that we’re making analyzing the data  each and every day we’re looking county by county state by state consulting with governors and local health officials at the present moment more than  million tests have been performed  and as you all are aware some  americans have tested positive for the coronavirus with now the losses over  americans  and our hearts are with their families beyond that we have been focusing not just on ensuring the testing is occurring but that the supplies are flowing  as the president just announced he made a decision today to deploy thousands of  masks directly to new york city’s public hospitals  and our team will speak about that in just a moment and also the president took the unprecedented step to direct the department of defense to use military healthcare personnel to operate all covid facilities at the javits center in new york at the convention center in new orleans and at the convention center in dallas  and we informed each of the governors of those states today that at their request we were making those military medical personnel available to operate in an allcovid facility but we would emphasize to people in that community who believe you’ve been impacted or have contracted the coronavirus contact your local healthcare provider  we anticipate in the new york area that your local healthcare provider will make the decision whether you are transferred to the javits center  and in all cases simply look to the guidance of your local governors about how best to receive the care that every american — every american is entitled to have beyond that let me say that we have been working through fema’s acquisition process not only to deploy but to gather up personal protective equipment and in just a few moments you will hear from admiral john polowczyk about the extraordinary progress that we have made in deploying not just the strategic national stockpile but also in identifying on the commercial marketplace around america and around the world literally millions of  masks surgical gowns gloves protective equipment  and at this point we’ve distributed some  ventilators  and you’ll hear today specifically about the states that have received those ventilators we’re just — this team has truly acted in an inspiring way and literally is working with dozens and dozens of people at the fema stabilization task force to make sure that we are leaving no stone unturned to find the supplies we need let me also say today you’re going to hear from jared kushner senior advisor to the president of the united states but someone that the white house coronavirus task force directed to work with fema on supply chain issues  and in recent weeks he’s been leading a working group in conjunction with fema that literally has identified millions of medical supplies around the nation and around the world  and we’re grateful for his efforts and his leadership finally you’ll hear from peter navarro who will explain the action the president took today using the defense production act but as you hear details today about medical supplies that have been distributed those that have been purchased those that we’re making available the ventilators distributed to hospitals and those that are available let me just remind every american that you can make a difference in ensuring that every patient has the treatment that they deserve  every healthcare provider every doctor and nurse and nurse’s assistant has the protective gear to provide the care that you would want your family to have by putting into practice the president’s “ days to slow the spread” i mean we want you to take to heart the president’s coronavirus guidelines for america first to protect your own health to protect the health of your family to protect the health of your community  we know so many people are asymptomatic and people that literally don’t know they have the coronavirus but have the ability to infect others  we want you to put these guidelines into practice social distancing using a drivethrough at a restaurant washing your hands on a regular basis but as we focus today on supplies make no mistake about it every american can make sure that our healthcare workers and more importantly americans that are struggling with coronavirus have the equipment to support their treatment by putting these principles into practice because the fewer americans that contract the coronavirus the fewer americans will have to enter our healthcare system  and that’ll continue to preserve the capacity in our healthcare economy so we thank the millions of americans who have responded in the first two days of “ days to slow the spread  and i’m just absolutely confident that in the days ahead every american is going to do their part — for your health your family’s health the health of your community — and to ensure the strength and vitality of the greatest healthcare system in the world with that let me introduce jared kushner to speak about the work that he’s been doing working with fema on ensuring a strong supply chain to meet this moment jared mr kushner  thank you mr vice president  and thank you for your great leadership on the task force and thank you to dr birx and dr fauci as well  it’s been an honor working with you these past few weeks when the vice president first asked me to help on the task force with different tasks i asked the president what he expected from the task force and how i can best serve him and the task force what the president asked is that all of the recommendations that we make be based on data  he wanted us to be very rigorous to make sure that we were studying the data collecting data  a lot of things in this country were happening very quickly and we wanted to make sure that we were trying to keep updating our models and making sure that we were making informed decisions and informed recommendations to him based on the data that we were able to collect and put together the president wanted to make sure that we had the people doing the best jobs and making sure that we had the right people focused on all the things that needed to happen to make sure that we can deliver in these unusual times for the american people the president also instructed me to make sure that i break down every barrier needed to make sure that the teams can succeed  this is an effort where the government is doing things that the government doesn’t normally do where we are stretching we’re acting very quickly  and the president wants to make sure that the white house is fully behind the different people running the different lines of effort to make sure that we get everything done in a speed that the president demands the president also wanted us to make sure we think outside the box make sure we’re finding all the best thinkers in the country making sure we’re getting all the best ideas and that we’re doing everything possible to make sure that we can keep americans safe and make sure we bring a quick end to this in the best way possible and balance all the different aspects that need to be thought of while we do this this truly is a historic challenge  we have not seen something like this in a very very long time  but i am very confident that by bringing innovative solutions to these hard problems we will make progress today we were briefing the president earlier  he asked me to come out and talk a little bit about what we’ve doing on the supply chain task force which admiral polowczyk has been leading  and what he’s been very impressed by is the way that we’ve been resourceful to find product all over the world all over the country  and we are finding ways to solve the different problems the president has been very very hands on in this  he’s really instructed us to leave no stone unturned  just this morning — very early this morning — i got a call from the president  he told me he was hearing from friends of his in new york that the new york public hospital system was running low on critical supply  he instructed me this morning  i called dr katz who runs the system asked him which supply was the most supply he was nervous about  he told me it was the  masks  i asked what his daily burn was  and i basically got that number called up admiral polowczyk made sure we had the inventory we went to the president today and earlier today the president called mayor de blasio to inform him that we were going to send a month of supply to the new york public hospital system to make sure that the workers on the frontline can rest assured that they have the  masks that they need to get through the next month we’ll be doing similar things with all the different public hospitals that are in the hotspot zones and making sure that we’re constantly in communications with the local communities one thing i will say just based on data is that we’ve been getting a lot of data from different governors and from different mayors and from different cities  one thing i’ve seen fema do very very well over the last week or so is now we’re getting realtime data from a lot of cities  people who have requests for different products and supplies a lot of them are doing it based on projections which are not the realistic projections  the projections change every day as we see the cases as we see the impacts of the “stop the spread” effort that this task force recommended and the president has been pushing forward so i do think that we’ll see that  hopefully there’ll be impact of that  and the task force has been working very hard through the fema group with admiral polowczyk to make sure that we’re getting the supplies to people before they run out and making sure that we’re doing it in a proper way i’d like to just introduce admiral polowczyk who before coming to this — i guess still is — he’s the vice director for logistics for the joint staff  i got a call from one of the senators saying “well why don’t you put a great military person in charge of the logistics and the supply chain and the defense production act  and i said “well the president already did that  this is the best man that we have in the country for supplies and logistics  he joined the task force  days ago over at fema and he’s built a team — really at the direction of the vice president — that includes people from fema omb the fda hhs the white house and from everywhere else and what they’ve don over the last  days has been really extraordinary  we’ve done things that the government has never done before quicker than they’ve ever done it before  and what we’re seeing now is we found a lot of supplies in the country  we’ve been distributing them where we anticipate there will be needs and also trying to make sure that we’re hitting places where there are needs so i can tell you the people on the — in the task force they’re working day and night  you’ve got a lot of people in the government  we recognize the challenge that america faces right now  we know what a lot of the people on the frontlines are facing the fear that they have that they won’t have the supplies they need  and our goal is to work as hard as we can to make sure that we don’t let them down so i just want to thank everybody  and with that i want to introduce admiral polowczyk who’s doing an amazing job rear admiral polowczyk  thank you mr kushner mr vice president so today i’m going to cover a couple items — a couple of — five things the first thing i’m going to talk about is resources pushed out from the federal government  and then i’m going to talk about this air bridge which you may have heard about  i’m going to talk about data  as you said we’re — mr kushner is absolutely right we’re trying to be data driven  and with that i’m going to talk a little bit about how we’re trying to expand the industrial base here to meet this challenge so the first thing i want to talk about is surgical masks  so we’ve all — we’ve quickly stated numbers here  so these — i’m about to go through several different slides to give you just scale and magnitude of federal resources that have been applied at the problem so  million surgical masks pushed out to state governments  for  masks  million  masks  and so if i was — if i was in a local hospital that was running short i would — i would look upward because the federal government has pushed out resources so for protective gloves  million   million pairs of protective gloves  for face shields  million face shields  for ventilators we have pushed to the states more than  ventilators  and i think as i was coming over here that number has changed slightly  i think it’s now  given to these states — to the predominantly of these states so we wanted you to have some numbers now as we’ve indicated we have ventilators in the national stockpile  we pushed ventilators out  we’re holding ventilators to put to the point of need  but we’re also buying ventilators asking the industrial base who produces approximately — prior to covid approximately  ventilators a year  we are going to over the next several months by the end of june work to acquire  and so one of the — one of the tools that we’re going to — i can anticipate needing — we’ve already executed — is all of those vendors that we’re buying them from will need — potentially will need help in their supply chains with their suppliers  we might rate orders  we might help them get ahead of others in that endeavor  so i think mr navarro is going to talk a little bit more on that later so let me talk about the air bridge  so it normally takes approximately  days to get from overseas the product — load it get it to the united states and distribute it  that’s about  days so to prime the pump so to speak we have lined on an air bridge to get product here faster working with our major suppliers as they have — as they work to fill orders to get more to healthcare workers now  we are working to align transportation to product now one of the things we’re also doing is the team that works for me are scouring the globe and finding pockets of personal protective equipment that might not otherwise be in the us hospital supply chain  that is also going on these flights  six completed and a number scheduled  twentyeight flights scheduled here in the near future we’re — we are working towards — some days we’ll have one flight some days there might be two flights multiple flights over the next coming days  these  or — as far as i can see out to a couple of weeks  then again matching product to flights to create volume in the supply chain here faster than the  days i’m just going to leave that up as i talk about a few other items  so let’s talk about new york city and the public health hospitals  i believe they’re called new york city health and hospitals the president directed — as i speak there are pallets being formed truck being loaded  i gave an address in new york city here an hour or two ago  and one of our distributors is making that happen and that delivery will happen tomorrow on the data front this is almost unprecedented  this is a commercial supply chain with six to seven major distributors of health equipment  we brought them all in and we said we need to make informed decisions and we are going to help make informed allocation decisions so within a matter of days feeding from their business systems — their enterprise resourcelike systems — i brought onboard a tool — a supply chain tower — that the dod was using to manage a supply chain for a very complex weapon system  their data goes into a data lake  we have a tool to be able to use their data and see it  i can tell what product is coming in what their orders are what they’re filling what they’re not filling and see the volume in the supply chain and understand what they’re doing down to the county level  we’re working to get it potentially down to the hospital level so this   respirators we took a look in there in the supply chain and we said we can’t — we have the volume to go do that  i called the distributor and they’re making — they’re making that happen we anticipate as the hotspots around the country — we anticipate these vendors at our direction helping them allocate product to the right place at the right time so if i can talk finally about expanding the industrial base  so the vice president was at walmart the other day who told him “i want to get in this game  how do i do that  so i got the call  we provided them specifications  and now walmart is going to have — use their suppliers to cut fabric make gowns sew product  but that’s not always the case  we have lots of folks that want to help i believe you will see in the coming days the use of the defense production act in creative ways to help people that are not doing this today to do it we have essentially leads — well the number yesterday was  — i believe it probably grew today — that we are working with to find how each one of those might need help to get in the game that’s not in the game to increase the throughput through the healthcare market again the president gave me one task get more to our healthcare workers now  and i took that to heart because i have — not that i don’t need that from the president that direction to move out — but i have family in new york  my sister is a nurse practitioner in a westchester hospital and my niece is a nurse on a long island hospital  and i have other healthcare professionals in the family  so i have skin in this game the president asked me to get more to the healthcare workers  i’m going to get more to healthcare workers i’d like to hand it over to mr navarro the vice president  inaudible the  going out tomorrow — rear admiral polowczyk  the  is going out as we speak the vice president  you might want to be very specific about that rear admiral polowczyk  it’ll be — it’ll be delivered tomorrow    can i ask a question the vice president  let me — let me be clear on that if i can  what jared announced what the admiral just unpacked is that pallets are being loaded right now to send   masks — rear admiral polowczyk   respirators the vice president  — to new york city to the public health hospitals rear admiral polowcyzk  to the public health warehouse in new york city the vice president  to all the healthcare workers help is on the way    based on the tools and the data you have available to you where is the logjam  where has it been  how have you identified that rear admiral polowcyzk  i think —    because as you say all this — when we have millions more ppes going out the door as you well know the frontline medical workers are not getting it rear admiral polowcyzk  so i would answer you — i would answer you this way we put up a lot of numbers  i said that if you’re not a — you’re in a hospital and you’re not seeing ppe i would look up to the state level first    but we aren’t —    we’ve hearing from governors sir saying they can’t get the medical equipment that they need    and the reason for that is because according to governors and also by the fact that we haven’t seen any numbers up there about what is going to the private sector can you tell us what percentage of the supplies on these large cargo planes are going to private companies versus fema versus the states  is it  percent rear admiral polowcyzk  so fema is — so this product that we’re moving is primarily commercial product that would enter the commercial system and be distributed through financial business transactions between hospitals and these distributors    so just to clarify that that explains why states say they’re bidding like they’re on ebay because the supplies are going to the private sector and then they have to go there to get the supplies rear admiral polowcyzk  that’s normally how things –that’s normally how things work right  so i’m not here to disrupt a supply chain and say — look these six distributors — six seven — they have six to seven hundred warehouses  they have trucks to go to the hospital door every day  we’re bringing product in  they’re filling orders for hospitals nursing homes like normal  i’m putting volume into that system i would say that we have the data now at last — so we put together this data element over the last you know what  thirteen days  get the people in look at the problem build this  i am now seeing truth about what’s in the supply chain  and i would say that there’s been some abnormal behavior okay    yes  thank you admiral  house oversight committee democrats say that fema officials told them that the ventilators that the government has ordered won’t be ready until june which is well after the expected peak  will the defense production act memo signed today do anything to speed that up rear admiral polowczyk  yes it will  mr navarro will talk about that  we’re on line to receive several thousand ventilators in the month of april and several thousand more ventilators in the month of may ramping up to a big number in june again going from you know an industry that produces about  annum —  annum to a — to a very big number    admiral are you confident that this system means the states with the greatest need are getting the supplies rear admiral polowczyk  yeah so —    because a lot of governors are saying that they can’t get what they need and different states have more pressing urgency obviously depending on the caseload rear admiral polowczyk  so we marry up — we’re marrying up where cdc — where the demand for covid is to what’s in the commercial system  we’re providing that to these — to the commercial system  and we are making allocations to those of most pressing need thirteen days — we now have the data  we now can make informed decisions  and so all of the “i need i need i need” i now know the volume that has been happening and needs to be happening    so admiral with that — and mr president i’d love for you to weigh on — the president  sure    — weigh in on this as well  you talk about — well you alluded to the fact there is possibly some shady business going on that the product is here in the united states and — rear admiral polowczyk  and coming here    yes and it is coming here  it’s coming from china  it’s in warehouses  it’s being made here in the united states  it’s in warehouses  but it’s going to the highest bidder  so what can be done to keep those products here in the united states not go overseas where companies are making a lot of money and — rear admiral polowczyk  yeah  i’m going to let mr navarro talk about that    — and get it distributed to the most critical places here in the us the president  yeah  sure  peter go ahead    i would love to hear — how is that being done  because doctors — i’ve talked to surgeons — mr navrrro  that’s great  great — great question    — on a regular basis mr navrrro  let me — let me give you the — the bigger view of the dpa and we’ll directly address that what we have essentially is a nation at war  we have a wartime president standing behind me  the defense production act is one of the most powerful weapons this administration can use to fight the invisible enemy of the virus when i spoke with you last week i explained the three points of the compass dpa can be used to hit  the first one is mobilization of the industrial base  this can involve things like repurposing from say a distiller like pernod ricard — from liquor to hand sanitizer  it can also involve expansion of production which is having honeywell — which makes  masks — opened a new factory in smithfield rhode island with respect to the second point in the compass — allocation of resources — we have two issues there  if you look at the manufacturer itself what you want to make sure is that the supply chain which can go seventiers deep has enough components in that supply chain so we can actually make what we need  and then once it’s made you also want to make sure that it goes to the right — right people and then the third point of the compass which — which addresses what you’re talking about is basically — “bust ‘em” i call it — hoarding of critical or threatened material so let me walk through what — what the president did today in terms of a strong action and what we’ve done with the dpa across those three points the first order that president trump signed was vigorous swift  it was the gm order which directed gm to make ventilators in kokomo indiana in trump time — which is to say “as fast as possible” as the president mentioned he’d spoke to mary barra today the ceo of gm  that is moving forward at the same time as the ford project is moving forward in rawsonville michigan and i’ve issued a challenge to those two companies à la “ford v ferrari” — this is ford versus gm  let’s see who gets those ventilators out first now the second point of the compass which these two orders address today is this allocation of resource issues  the ventilator companies themselves expressed concern that in this rush to build ventilators there would be pressure on that supply chain  so what they requested that we do and the president do is to use the dpa to give this gentleman here — who’s one of the strongest gentlemen in the world in terms of applying things — is to give him the ability to prioritize that supply chain for those ventilator manufacturers  and he will do things like give them what’s called a “do rating” in the defense procurement which will allow them to get what they need now the second order which the president signed today has to do with the other part of the equation which is once they make the stuff okay does it go to the right folks  and this is a  order  and to be frank over the last several days we’ve had some issues making sure that all of the production that  does around the world — enough of it is coming back here to the right places so what’s going to happen with the signing of that order in trump time is we’re going to resolve that issue with  probably by tomorrow at close of business because we can’t afford to lose days or hours or even minutes in this crisis now the third part of the compass — this third point there — this gets to the hoarding issue  the president stood up here with — he’s the commanderinchief but we have a sheriff in town too attorney general barr  and he stood up here with attorney general barr and bill barr said “i’m going to go out and bust them  and guess what  three days ago doj went into a warehouse in jersey grabbed ppe  and the beauty of that — the beauty of that it wasn’t only seized but within hours it was turned around and given to healthcare professionals in new york and new jersey  that’s a beautiful thing  that’s a beautiful case of using the dpa now what’s going to happen tomorrow is the president is going to sign another order which is in the works  this is interesting there is a black market springing up which you have described where we’re having people bid against each other  brokers come in they’re bidding and bidding on all this different ppe  it’s driving the price up  and guess what  you know where it’s going  the domestic sources here are being exported when president trump heard about that he said “that’s not going to happen anymore under my watch  so tomorrow we’re bringing that order  and what it’s going to do is it’s going to empower customs and border protection with the help of people like the post office and express mail consigners like ups to basically deal with that issue so we are going to crack down unmercifully  and i would say to the hoarders out there and the brokers that are trying to make money off of the misery of people in this country around the world that’s got to stop  and if you’ve got inventory what you need to do is pick up a phone and not call somebody out in — around the world  you call fema and say “we got some stuff  we’ll give it to you at a fair price and be done with that because that stuff has absolutely got to stop    inaudible mr navarro  so that’s — that’s — hang on  hang on  so that’s — that’s what we’re going to be looking for  and when we hear cases like this we’re going to aggressively issue order after order to crack down on it now before — this is not my role to take a bunch of questions but let me tell you one other thing before i leave the podium  it’s a story which i’d love to share with you today because this again illustrates the key principles of this president and this vice president which is to wed the full force of the federal government with the full power of private enterprise and just two days ago we at the white house got an urgent sos from the chief of police of the new york police department  and they are in a situation now because of the strain on their resources where personnel such as their homicide detectives were having to go on into houses and deal with covid issues without protective gear now the beauty of this president is because of his leadership we were able to solve that problem in two phone calls  two phone calls  the first one went to phebe novakovic at the general dynamics  “phebe can you call tom kennedy at raytheon  i need you guys to basically scoop up all the tyvek suits you can and find any gloves you can” this president under his leadership and the voluntary efforts and the pride and patriotism you talked about it earlier that — we had  tyvek suits delivered to the new york pd within  hours  that’s — that’s a new record in trump time at the same time a second phone call was made the tara engel at pernod ricard and laura lane at ups  they were on the same phone call  and i said “tara laura we got this issue they need hand sanitizer  literally within two hours we had  drums  gallons of hand sanitizer on a ups truck heading up to the nypd  and it probably arrived today with a promise from pernod that they will continue to supply the nypd throughout the course of this crisis so this is a beautiful thing that america is rallying to  we are becoming a stronger more united nation  and i couldn’t be more proud of this president this administration these guys up here who are doing a heck of a job organizing the supply chain and my promise to you is that the president is going to use that dpa to make sure that the american people particularly our healthcare professionals get the ppe the medicines everything we need so let me — let me stop there  i don’t think it’s my place here to field a bunch of questions the president  no you’re doing a good job  thank you mr navarro  thank you    mr navarro what’s the status of the “buy american” executive order the president  go ahead  go ahead  answer — mr navarro  sure the president  you go ahead mr navarro  okay — the president  come here  come here  come mr navarro  one of the — one of the things that this crisis has taught us sir is that we are dangerously overdependent on a global supply chain for our medicines like penicillin our medical supplies like masks and our medical equipment like ventilators we have — right now as we speak over  countries have already imposed some forms of export restrictions in their country against the rest of the world  and what we’ve — what we’re learning from that is that no matter how many treaties you have no matter how many alliances no matter how many phone calls when push comes to shove you run the risk as a nation of not having what you need and if there’s any vindication of the president’s “buy american secure borders and a strong manufacturing base” philosophy strategy and belief it is this crisis — because it underscores everything that we see there so the “buy american” order which — which is going through process would do a couple things  it would simply say — not during this crisis because we don’t want to disrupt anything  i want to be really clear about that  but going forward after this is over the va dod hhs and this government buys american for essential medicines our medical countermeasures and the medical supplies and equipment we need at the same time it will deregulate so we can get the fda and epa to facilitate domestic manufacturing  and then innovate  because the key here — the key here is having advanced manufacturing on us soil that can leapfrog other countries so we don’t have to worry about competing against cheap sweatshop labor lax environmental regulations different tax regimes and the massive subsidies of foreign governments who are actually directly attacking our industrial base so be patient with that sir  it’s — the other priorities we have right now are to dpa and what the task force is doing  but if we learn anything from this crisis it should be never again  never again should we have to depend on the rest of the world for our essential medicines and countermeasures the president  and by the way we’ve cut them out also to be honest  we’ve stopped orders going from certain places  and in a couple of places — like we had a big order going to italy on important outfits and some ventilators and it was going to italy  they made the order a long time ago  and i said “you got to let it go  they had an order  and i could have cut it under the act  i could have cut it  i said “nope you can’t do that  you got to let it go  you know they have big problems we had an order going to spain and i said “let it go  i could have stopped it  i said “let it go  we’re going to be fine  i said “let it go  so it works that way also one other thing as to your question oftentimes — and we’ve told this to the governors — mike we’ve been very strong on this — have — if you think there’s bidding between federal government and state let us know and we’ll drop out immediately or you drop out and we lower the price    but states are bidding against each other the president   no no  if we’re bidding against each other i said find out who it is  and usually they know  everyone knows  and we’re notified and we get notified and we’ll either drop out or they’ll drop out  but we have another problem there are  countries out there beyond the states  there are  countries that have this problem  and they’re ordering too  it’s really a mess now in a little while the hardest thing to get are the ventilators because they’re — you know it takes a while to build them  and we have a lot  we have thousands of them being built right now  in a little while they’ll be worth about five dollars  but right now they’re very valuable  and we’re going to have a lot of them being shipped and in fact that’s why general motors called up before — mary  that’s why others called up two days ago  they called up that they’re all in production  and they’ll start — they’re starting to arrive in a week and a half  but there’ll be a time when we’re going to build stockpiles by the way the states should have been building their stockpile  we have almost  in our stockpile  and we’ve been building it and we’ve been supplying it  but the states should be building we’re a backup  we’re not an ordering clerk  we’re a backup  and we’ve done an unbelievable job  like for instance who ever heard of a governor calling up “sir can you build us a hospital of  rooms  and we built it  “can you build us four medical centers  we built it  “can you deliver a ship — a hospital ship — with  rooms  and we did it  and we did it in los angeles too we’ve been an unbelievable — we’ve done an unbelievable job — these people  and so — and thousands of people behind them  but we’re a backup  ideally those hospitals would have had all this equipment  ideally those states should have had all this equipment and i think they will the next time you know you heard the case where thousands of ventilators could have been had at a very inexpensive price three years ago  and a certain state decided not to exercise that right because they wanted to build a road or they wanted to build something else because it’s big money  you’re talking about — i think it was a billion dollars but you’re talking about a lot of money for something that may never happen  because normally on a ventilator — other than a pandemic or an epidemic — you wouldn’t — you wouldn’t need anything like this  hospitals have three ventilators — big hospitals — and they get by with it  and now they want thousands  i mean they want thousands of ventilators  you call up a governor and he’ll say “sir could you send us  ventilators  nobody has ever heard of a thing like this so they’ve done some job  let me just tell you when secretary mnuchin spoke they want you to call not “com” but sbagov — okay — for the application and for information  okay  so it’s sba — small business — sbagov okay  if you don’t mind yeah let’s go  please    thank you sir  thank you mr  president  i want to follow up from a question yesterday regarding i think your administration’s denial of the expansion of obamacare special enrollment period in the wake of this pandemic in your own words — vp pence gave a fiveminute nonanswer — but people facing this pandemic — illness and even worse — most experts say that having healthcare is critical to our nation’s health and financial wellbeing the president  right    can you assure americans tonight that you will reopen obamacare marketplace so that they can be covered in this time of combined health — the president  well we’re — we’re doing better than that    — and financial crisis the president  yeah  no i understand the question  and we’re doing better than that  we’re going to try and get a cash payment to the people  and we’re working out the mechanics of that with legislature so we’re going to try and get them a cash payment because just opening it up doesn’t help as much  so we’re going to work it out  so we’re going to try and get for that certain group of people — it’s a certain group of people — a cash payment go ahead    i really want to ask you about masks but i also just wanted to follow up on a couple of hanging threads there  on just the question earlier about the bidding what happens though when states are bidding against each other on those markets the president  well they have that and they have to work that out  what they should do is they should have — long before this pandemic arrived they should have been on the open market just buying  there was no competition  you could have made a great price the states have to stock up  it’s like one of those things  they waited  they didn’t want to spend the money because they thought this would never happen  and their shelves in some cases were bare  and by the way in some cases they weren’t  they were beautifully serviced  they did a good job  but in some cases their shelves were bare so the best thing they can do is when times become normalized — and they will hopefully soon — and actually you’re going to have a lot of excess material because so much is being done right now in terms of protective gear protective outfits  a lot is being done  it’s going to be — within six months it’s going to be sold for the right price  they got to stack up for the next time but we are doing that  and the admiral has done a fantastic job  senator schumer wrote a letter today and he says “you should put a military man in charge  i said “well chuck if you knew a little bit more we have one of the most highly respected people in the military the admiral  this is what he does too very professionally  and he’s in charge  but chuck didn’t know that okay  jeff please    mr president you tweeted this morning about your call with saudi arabia’s mbs the president  yeah    we’ve had some people say that the figures that you cited — between  million and  million barrels per day — is not what they’re agreeing to  can you be more specific about what exactly they told us the president  i don’t know what they’re agreeing to  i think they might agree to more than that look russia — russia —    did he tell you that sir the president  yeah  he did say that actually  russia talked about  million barrels  russia and saudi arabia are fighting over this  and as everybody knows it’s you know really killing an industry hurting russia badly hurting saudi arabia badly i said “this is an easy one  it should be an easy one  and it may be  and it may be more than that  i was actually told it may be   as i told somebody before it may be  and it may be more than that  maybe it’s   maybe it goes up to   could be as high as  and you know there’s a tremendous oversupply right now  that industry was — it was oversupplied before the virus  and when the virus came along they lost   percent of the world  and there’s an unbelievable — you can’t get a ship now  every ship is loaded to the gills sitting out someplace in the ocean  they’re storage tanks  they’re not even ships they’re storage tanks so it would be great for russia it would be great for saudi arabia  i hope they make that deal but that’s what they told me they said —    inaudible  million be — the president  — they said it’s —    — enough to address the oversupply issues the president  well i think it will be hopefully soon  i think hopefully they’ll announce something soon  now can a deal be broken  can something happen where it doesn’t happen  i guess  in which case there’s another alternative  but i’d rather not see that other alternative  i hope they can make a deal    what do you mean when you say the “alternative” the president  they both want — i think they both want to make a deal  and they’re both smart  they love their countries  they want to make a deal  it’s good but it’s also good for the world if they do because you save an industry    mr president — the president  yeah please  go ahead  go ahead in the back please    what do you by “cash payments” the president  i’m going to let mike because we went over this very specifically  and i’ll let you talk about it mike because you responded last time the vice president   right  thank you mr president  as i said yesterday the president has put a priority on ensuring that no american has to worry about the cost of coronavirus testing  and we’ve been working every day to make sure that americans don’t have to worry about the cost of treatment and at this point the white house coronavirus task force is working on a proposal for the president to use some of the  billion that we’re making available to hospitals to compensate the hospitals directly for any coronavirus treatment that they provide to uninsured americans  we’re working out the details of that  the president will make a final decision  tomorrow we expect an announcement but the president has made it very clear we don’t want american to worry about the cost of getting a test or the cost of getting treatment  and we’ve expanded coverage through medicaid  we’ve expanded coverage through medicare  health insurance companies around the country including blue cross just today announced that all of their members will be waiving all copayments on coronavirus treatment  but for those some  million uninsured americans the president has directed the coronavirus task force to find a way to make sure that they know we will find a way to pay for your coronavirus treatment  and the president will be addressing that and announcing that tomorrow    mr president — the president  go ahead    — a point of clarification and then a followup question  yesterday you said that you spoke to florida governor ron desantis before he issued his stayathome order  did you advise him to issue that order the president  no but i talked to him about it  and he wants to do what’s right for the people of florida  he’s been a great governor  you could see that just by his popularity which is extraordinary  we’re proud of him  he’s done a fantastic job and he made the decision but we spoke before he made the decision yes    and he had also said that he is considering putting people who are suspected of having coronavirus or who have tested for positive for it in isolation centers and that he would potentially use — the president  that i haven’t heard  no that i haven’t heard    so he hasn’t consulted with you the president  i haven’t heard that yes please    thank you mr president  ebony bowden from the new york post  a few hours ago mayor de blasio the mayor of new york said that new yorkers leaving their homes should wear masks  they should also wear masks when they’re with other people  are you considering that kind of recommendation on a federal level  and if you are how would you prevent a rush on  masks the president  well i think they’re going to be coming out with regulations on that  and if people want to abide by them frankly i don’t think you — i don’t think there’ll be mandatory because some people don’t want to do that  but if people wanted — as an example on the masks if people wanted to wear them they can  if people wanted to use scarves which they have — many people have them — they can  in many cases the scarf is better it’s thicker  i mean you can — if you — depending on the material it’s thicker  but they can do that if they want now a recommendation is coming out  we’ll see what that recommendation is but —    is that a cdc recommendation sir the president  but i will say this they can pretty much decide for themselves right now    would that be nationwide  and can i also just ask– the president  nationwide    nationwide — the president  yeah    — not just for hotspots and then i think this is best for dr birx but we’ve heard some differing guidance here  the who and even the surgeon general have talked about various studies that show that masks in addition to maybe not even being helpful to protecting people may actually increase the rates of illness because people touch the masks then they touch themselves the president  sure    can you talk a little bit about just the evolution of — the president  all right maybe i will ask —    — your thinking on this the president  — dr birx  and you might mention that other point also yeah thanks dr birx  no no thank you  so i hope you got from the conference today that we’re triangulating data that we know from the case numbers the testing numbers the supplychain numbers to create an integrated picture so that we can really support hospitals in their needs  and i think that level of granularity is really critical secondly i just want to make the point that we really applaud the governors that are looking at a wholeofstate or a wholeofmetro approach  and what do i mean by that  the united states going into this had about  ventilators across the united states and another  to  anesthesia machines  that’s about five times what most of the european countries have but it’s a matter of distribution to need  and i really applaud the governors that are bringing together their public hospitals with their more private hospitals and their visibility across their state  because what we tried to talk about yesterday is every state every county is different  and that’s why we’re looking at it at that level of granularity and as we move through this epidemic the needs need to be very tailored to those counties and frankly those hospitals  i mean there’s a reason why the president and mr kushner have been very much involved in finding out what the public hospitals need  why is that  because the public hospital sometimes have the weakest supply chain because they’re often sometimes not as attractive to private sector distributors or they may be too busy caring for the needs of patients to be really on top of their order forms and their supply chains so really listening to the community that’s at the front of this fight and getting feedback from those specific communities no matter where they are and listening to the frontline healthcare workers because it’s their reality that is important to all of us whether you’re the mayor or the governor or the federal government and if they’re saying they need something we have to work together to supply that and so that’s what you’re seeing with this triangulation  every county will move through this differently and that allows us to move around these vital issues that protect the frontline healthcare workers and protect the patients through the ventilators to make sure that the supply chain is aligned with the need as it happens now you have to have very good data in order to be willing to work in that level of granularity  and that’s what we’ve been working on to really develop that level of granularity to ensure that so i just wanted to say one other thing about testing just to give you the bottomline data of what we’re seeing  we appreciate the groups who are reporting not everyone is reporting yet  and this is part of us trying to understand at a very granular level we do have two states that do have  percent positives and that’s new york and new jersey  so that confirms very clearly that that’s a very clear and important hot zone louisiana though has  percent of their tests are positive  michigan connecticut indiana georgia illinois — so that should tell you where the next hotspots are coming — are at  percent test positive  and then colorado dc rhode island and massachusetts are at  percent there’s a significant number of states still under  percent everyone that i didn’t discuss  california and washington remain steady at an  percent rate so what we’re seeing finally is testing improving — more testing being done still a high level of negatives — in states without hotspots allowing them to do more of the surveillance and containment and then prioritizing this new rapid test kit to those areas that may not have the same amount of access — to the indian health services and to the public health institutions and the public health and state labs so that they can use that and start forward leaning into surveillance now we know there are people waiting for tests and they’re waiting for tests because when these areas became very — when they got onto the logarithmic curve we prioritized people whose decisions — where the test decision would make it critical for their care  and so we prioritized hospitals and we prioritized nurses and doctors and frontline workers the president good dr birx  so that means if you went through a drivethrough or you went through your doctor you could have that delay so the masks so what i tried to give you is how we’re using data in a very granular way  and so there are — there is experiential data  when you look at communities that have oftentimes utilized masks — in general for personal protection — from when they particularly are themselves sick and have used their mask in public  and we’ve looked at the rate of this  in those populations  and then we’re looking at the scientific evidence to bring those two pieces together let me just say one thing though the most important thing is the social distancing and washing your hands  and we don’t want people to get an artificial sense of protection because they’re behind a mask  because if they’re touching things — remember your eyes are not in the masks so if you’re touching things and then touching your eyes you’re exposing yourself in the same way so we don’t want people to feel like “oh i’m wearing a mask  i’m protected and i’m protecting others  you may be protecting others but don’t get a false sense of security that that mask is protecting you exclusively from getting infected because there are other ways that you can get infected because of the number of asymptomatic and mild cases that are out there and so this worries us and that’s why the debate is continuing about the mask  because we don’t want — when we’re trying to send a signal that every single person in this country needs to stay six feet away from everybody that needs to be washing their hands constantly and know where their hands are — to send a signal that we think a mask is equivalent to those pieces so in the — when the advisory comes out it will be an additive piece if it comes out rather than saying “this is a substitute for…  and we want to make sure everybody understands it is not a substitute for the presidential guidelines that have already gone out and to be absolutely clear about that    dr birx can i ask a follow up about the testing please the president  go ahead    dr birx there’s a lot of evidence we’re seeing — that the experts are saying that a high number of these tests could be producing false — false negatives  so — dr birx  of the roche and abbott tests    that as many as one in three tests might be providing false negatives  and i was wondering — maybe you could explain or — dr birx  that would be almost be impossible with —    — tell a little about the science dr birx  — having  percent positives  you — if that was true you would have  percent positive —    are you concerned about the underlying data — dr birx  — or  percent positive so what i can tell you is the number of positive tests is tracking very closely with the number of cases diagnosed  so i don’t — i will look into that i look at the roche and abbott numbers every night  they’re trending exactly in the same way  and that’s important when you’re validating data to really validate “does this same site” — in other words i’m looking between testing sites to see are there consistencies  is there an anomaly  to make sure for what you just very specifically asked  so i will go back and look at it more carefully  i haven’t seen that kind of anomaly this is — this same platform is being used across the country and that’s a range from what i reported  percent positivity up to  percent positivity  and that range reflects also what we’re seeing with the hotspots and the number of cases  and frankly – i mean we hate to talk about it but it also tracks with the hospitalizations independent of diagnosis and the mortality that we’re seeing  so all of those pieces validate together    there’s no concern that there might – people might be getting a false sense of security or that we might not be seeing all of the data here on – and who has it dr birx  well i’m telling you i’m still missing  percent of the data from reporting  i have  tests reported in we’ve done  million  so there is — and it could be those sites so we do need to see all — the bill said you need to report  we’re still not receiving  percent of the test    dr birx with regard to the test the president’s sample collection took one minute results reported back in  minutes  i realize you’re the president of the united states but when will everyone get to take a test that works that quickly and you get results that quickly dr birx  so these are new tests and we have prioritized the groups that we think have the least access to testing now  and who do we mean by that  we mean the indian health service — they’re often in remote areas rural areas  the governors of the northwestern states that may not have the advantage of these highthroughput machines that are often across the east coast and in high metro areas — colorado — and then across the west coast so we’ve prioritized the presidential  test to the indian health services and public health labs so that they can support nursing home testing and other areas where we think surveillance is absolutely key  so at this moment they’re prioritized in that way the vice president  it’s thirteen to twelve hundred dr birx  yes  of them are going out that way    so do more of those tests need to be made in order for more people — the president  they are being made dr birx  yeah    okay  so in a matter of – the president  they’re moving very quickly — it’s happening — in this case dr birx  so i’m glad you asked that because today there’s  of these machines already out there  we’re trying to find out exactly where everyone is because you can see that gives you amazing flexibility  because if people would allow it to be loaned to a state that’s in a hotspot or a state where you want to do additional surveillance  tests  machines is a huge amount  and it really gets to your very question about how we can prioritize what we have at the same time we’re moving out what is new and so really figuring out who should those go to how — who can we ask communities — because these will be in the community — to share those machines into the community who need the testing now  and i think that’s really an incredible question that really needs to be answered over the next  hours    dr birx a point of clarity about the facecovering guidance  you said it’s still a point of debate  you said — you used the phrase “the guidance if it comes out  is the guidance coming out and when the vice president  yes  yes    and — and when sir the vice president  in the — in the days ahead  we’re currently working through the task force taking the consultation advice of cdc our top health experts and we’ll be bringing forward the guidance from the cdc in the next several days dr birx  just remember it’s not a substitute for everything that we’re asking people to do  and just to — to everybody out there across the country when we say no gatherings of  we’re looking at — we want it to be clear  if you have a family of  we don’t want you to be split up  but we don’t expect people to be having dinner parties cocktail parties i mean i know you’ve seen the slope in the united states versus the slope in italy  and we have to change that slope  we have to change the logarithmic curve that we’re on  we see country after country having done that  what it means in the united states is not everyone is doing it so we’re only as strong as every community every county every state every american following the guidelines to a t  and i can tell by the curve and as it is today that not every american is following it  and so this is really a call to action  we see spain we see italy we see france we see germany when we see others beginning to bend their curves  we can bend ours but it means everybody has to take that same responsibility as americans    mr president    dr birx does that mean —    mr president can i have a quick followup on oil please  in your conversations with russia and saudi arabia did you have to make any concessions to get them to agree to cut their production the president  no    like did you agree to cut us production of oil the president  no no  we didn’t discuss that  they want to do that that’s good for their countries and we did not discuss that now    mr president nbc news has learned that the navy is set to fire the captain of the uss theodore roosevelt after he raised red flags about the  outbreak on his ship  it appears as if he’s being punished for trying to save the lives of the sailors in his command  what’s your assessment the president  oh i don’t think so at all  but we’re going to wait a little while because i understand there’s a news conference by the secretary of defense about that  but you know i don’t — i don’t agree with that at all  not at all  not even a little bit yeah    mr president thank you  this morning you said once again that new york got off to a late start and they should have pushed harder  but governors and other state leaders say they rely on the federal government to assess the situation and how risky it is  and they want to know how would they have known to start sooner without your guidance the president  well they have experts  and frankly long after we came out and talked about it — look how would i have known to cut off china  i cut off china very early  and if i didn’t we would have a chart that you wouldn’t believe  so how would i know to do that  how would i know to cut off europe  i cut off europe very early  i mean you have to make a decision  people knew that some bad things were going on and they got off to a late start  and some others got off to a late start also  but we cut off china  if we didn’t cut off china we would have been in some big trouble  and we cut it off    but do — the president  and you know what  we cut it off way early go ahead    mr president to follow up on the insurance point and a separate question that came in from a colleague who can’t be in the room — the president  too bad    on the insurance point is there going to — the president  who are you with  who are you with    roll call  is there going to be an opportunity for insurance companies — if in fact hospitals are compensated for uncompensated care – the president  right  right    — are the insurance companies going to also get compensated for extraordinary expenses that they may have  or are they assuming that cost the president  so we haven’t discussed it but we’re talking to them  you know getting them not to pay copays in the case of the big ones was a tremendous thing  that’s a lot of money they gave up  but we’re discussing that with the insurance companies    okay the president  we’ll let you know  it’ll be pretty quickly yeah go ahead    on — i have a question on japan sir  they are expanding their entry ban to include the united states  are you planning to take any similar action to ban japanese nationals from coming to the us as a result of this crisis the president  well we’re looking at a lot of things and a lot of different bans  we have more bans than anybody  we had bans when bans weren’t fashionable if you remember right at the beginning of this administration it was for different reasons  but we’ve had bans long before people thought of bans when i did china it had never been done before  i was the first one to do it  remember that  it had never — according to what i read in all the papers this had never been done  this is a terrible thing to do  and four weeks later they were all saying “we’re lucky we did it  so we’re looking at it  no we heard that  and i think it’s fine that they do that  they’re trying to protect their country and we have to protect our country yeah please    mr president –    mr president i asked you yesterday about stayathome orders – the president  yeah    — and if that you know decision should be left in the hands of governors or if you’re considering telling the entire nation “stay at home” the president  yeah    so just today the — georgia’s governor finally issued a stayathome order – the president  yeah    — saying that individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt bad but we didn’t know that until the last  hours  is that ignorance gross incompetence the president  he’s a good governor brian kemp  he’s a very good –    you’ve been having calls with these governors the president   he’s a good governor and he has to make his own decision on that  i let the states — i think we’re about  percent positive on that if you look i think it’s about  percent of the states have got the stayathome  brian is a great governor  we’ll — it’s his decision  he made that decision  ultimately he decided to go along with it    do you think it was smart decision to wait the president  and they’re doing — and they’re doing well  and the state is doing well in many respects yeah go ahead please    this is another question from a colleague who couldn’t make it in today  from emily goodin at the daily mail  i had a question in regards to the russian plane that landed at jfk with medical supplies  did the united states ask russia for this aid or is it just accepting it the president  we’re accepting it  it was a very nice offer from president putin  i spoke to him the other night as i told you  and they had excess medical equipment things  and i’ll take it  i’ll take it    he just offered you — the president  i think it’s very nice  we’ve had some from china  we also help other countries  we like doing that  like i said before if we have excess stuff we let it go out  we let some go out where frankly they had orders for it and i didn’t want to stop orders  it was a very nice gesture on behalf of president putin  and i could’ve said “no thank you” or i could have said “thank you  and it was a large plane of very highquality medical supplies  and i said “i’ll take it”    is he offering any further aid in your conversation the president  i think he would if we asked for it  but he was very nice  it was part of the call  he suggested — he said “we have it  it’s additional  they have very big difficulties with this virus also as you know — russia  i thought it was a very nice gesture on behalf of president putin  i could have said “no i don’t want it” or i could have said “i’ll take it  and you know what i said  “i’ll take it”    and would you accept further aid the president  i think so yeah  if they sent things that we need i’d take it  sure  nice gesture    are there concerns about russians using it as propaganda the president  i’m not concerned about russian propaganda not even a little bit  he offered a lot of medical highquality stuff that i accepted  and that may save a lot of lives  i’ll take it every day please in the back    mr  president you said — in january you tweeted that you stand with the people of iran since the beginning of your presidency and you’ll continue to stand with the people of iran given the fact that they’re so hard hit with the coronavirus — the president  oh they’re very hard hit  they’re very hard hit    but would you consider — the president  in a lot of ways they’re hard hit  they’re hit in — with their economy with their military and with obviously the virus  they’re very hard hit    would you consider easing sanctions to allow medical supplies to get in the president  well they haven’t even asked us to do that okay    but we know that sanctions hit the people not the government the president  you know what  they haven’t even asked us to do that    but how does a person — the president  if they want to meet we’d love to meet and we’d love to settle the whole thing out  but i doubt they’ll be —    but how does a — realistically how does a person in tehran pick up the phone and call you  i mean — the president  i think they love america  i think the iranians love america  i think they’d love to be free  i think they’d love to have just some of the things that we have you know i remember iran many years ago — friends of mine were always in iran  they were doing real estate deals in iran  they were building beautiful buildings all over iran  apartment houses  it was — they were very successful  and then one day that came to an end but you know what  the people of iran they remember that  it was a long time ago but not so long ago  and they remember it  and i’ll tell you they love america  they love what we stand for  and we’re not looking for cha — we’re not looking for government takeover government change you know this country has been through that many times  that doesn’t work    so inaudible health of the people would you encourage other countries to — who are maybe concerned about running afoul — the president  well what i did — yeah  what i did as you know —    — of sanctions to — the president  — i put it out very publicly with respect to iran  i said if they need help with respect to the virus we’d love to send — we have the greatest medical professionals in the world  we’d love to send them over    so what countries are you encouraging perhaps to — to lend their support  because there are many countries that feel — the president  i’m not encouraging or discouraging  they’ve been a very hostile country  they made a deal that president obama should have never made  it was a shortterm deal giving them  billion giving them  billion in cash  green  fill up this room five times  look —    but your administration — do you have a moral responsibility to — the president  no  not at all  nobody has even asked me about it  i have a moral responsibility to help them if they ask  if they — if they needed help i would certainly consider different things    well the united nations says they need help the president  well that’s up to the united nations  i’m talking about us  and what happens is if they wanted help — because they have a very big case of virus  a very very big case  it — one of the worst on earth if you believe what you’re reading  and i happen to believe what i see and what i know  and if they wanted help we’d give them help yeah  you had one in the back please    yes mr president and a question for jared too  the — you talk about a granular approach to receiving data from these different states and regions to try and figure out what they need  the president — you just enacted the dpa on ventilators and masks  are there are signals from across the country that might indicate there are other things besides masks and ventilators that are slowly kind of rising in terms of need — like hand sanitizer for instance the president  go ahead mr kushner  sure  so the first — the first issue that we’ve been dealing with was really the ventilators  that was the number one number two and number three from all the states what we’ve been finding is that people have a lot of these requests based on the models  and what we’ve been trying to do over at fema is say to the states “well if you would like ventilators we need to see — first look in your states  right  so for example in northern jersey they’re going down to southern jersey and they’re finding ventilators and trying to relocate them to where they have their hotspots the second thing that we’ve done asked them to survey for alternative ventilators dr birx spoke before about the anesthesia machines and the ability to — to convert them to be ventilators  so we’re asking people to be resourceful inside their states before they come to the federal government the third thing we’ve been asking states to do is to provide what their daily utilization rates are  so everyone is asking for everything  one congressman got a call from his local hospital saying “i need  ventilators  and he said “well you don’t have a covid patient within four counties why do you want  ventilators  and he says “well we just want to be safe  we’re very nervous right now” so what you have all over the country is a lot of people are asking for things that they don’t necessarily need at the moment  and the job of fema and admiral polowczyk has been to try to make sure that we’re getting the real data from the cities from the states so that we can make realtime allocation decisions based on the data and right now what’s happening is a lot of the different cities and states are providing fema that — that information  we’re talking to them daily  they’re updating that information daily  and that’s enabling the federal government to make much more informed decisions on where they position ventilators you also have a situation where in some states fema allocated ventilators to the states  and you have instances where in cities they’re running out but the state still has a stockpile  and the notion of the federal stockpile was it’s supposed to be our stockpile it’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use  so we’re encouraging the states to make sure that they’re assessing the needs they’re getting the data from their local — local situations and then trying to fill it with the supplies that we’ve given them the same thing with the masks  so the  mask is actually an item that wasn’t used as frequently in the medical profession before this  it was used mostly for diseases  so speaking to a lot of the doctors and hospital administrators they would say they used actually a very low percentage of the  masks what the president and the vice president were able to do with congress was to get the waiver so that you could expand the pool because a lot of the masks were used to — for the construction industries  now there’s a much bigger pool of masks in the country  there was a stockpile  they distributed that based on where they anticipated a lot of the need would go  but a lot of that still is stuck with the states and it hasn’t trickled down to the right places within the states so i would just encourage you when you have governors saying that the federal government haven’t — hasn’t given them what they need i would just urge you to ask them “well have you looked within your state to make sure that you haven’t been able to find the resources” unlike other countries a lot of the medical system in america is a private — it’s not a — it’s not a public governmentcontrolled  so you have to get the data from what’s in their state look at it in that way and then make sure that they’re being resourceful in a way to do that  and also ask them what their utilization percentage is because if one governor is asking for more ventilators and if the federal government sends them more than they need the goal here is not to have ventilators sitting in a warehouse where you have another state or you have people who need them so what we’re trying to do is make informed datadriven decisions both on ventilators masks any other supply we can get to make sure it’s going to the people who need them    i wonder if you could weigh in on the reports of which i’m sure you’re aware where unnamed white house officials have described your role as being something of running a shadow task force  how do you describe your role  how do you describe the qualifications you bring to your role mr kushner  yeah  i would just say very simply — look the president asked the vice president to run the task force  the vice president asked me to assist  i’ve been serving really at the direction of vice president and he’s asked me to get involved in different projects the vice president and i speak probably sometimes   times a day  but everything that i’m doing is at the direction of the vice president  if some people are talking to you that means they’re probably not informed as to what’s going on  but i can assure you that i’m speaking with dr birx dr fauci the vice president and the president multiple times a day to make sure that i’m accomplishing and focusing on the objectives that the vice president deems a priority    jared a followup on the ventilators — the president  or they don’t exist    — and the national stockpile the president  or the sources don’t exist  they’re fake persons okay  a lot of fake sources out there  they don’t exist  i read about it — for a long time i’ve been reading  a lot of them — fakes sources  they don’t exist go ahead  please    thank you mr president  jared what triggers sending a ventilator from the national stockpile to a state  in other words how sick does somebody have to be to get one of these national ventilators mr kushner  well that’s not the issue that we’re — that’s not the criteria  you have the states basically putting in the requests and they’re giving us their utilization — their utilization percentages  so it’s a very simple formula  the states should know how many ventilators they have in their states  and by the way some governors you speak to or senators they don’t know what’s in their state  you know some governors i’ll speak to and they’ll know to the number how many ventilators they have in their state because that’s the first thing a good manager will do what a lot of the voters are seeing now is that when you elect somebody to be a mayor or a governor or a president you’re trying to think about who will be a competent manager during the time of crisis  this is a time of crisis and you’re seeing certain people are better managers than others so what i would say is that the way that the federal government is trying to allocate is they’re trying to make sure a you have your data right  don’t ask us for things when you know that — when you don’t know what you have in your own state just because you’re scared you asked your medical professionals and they don’t know  you have to take inventory of what you have in your own state and then you have to be able to show that there’s a real need and so we prepositioned a lot of things because most governors off the bat didn’t know what they needed  but fema has a joint command with admiral polowczyk admiral giroir and pete gaynor where every couple hours when their requests come in they evaluate the request they all vote on the request  and then if there is something that they want to elevate to the taskforce they bring it to the vice president to make a recommendation the vice president  and jared if i may you might ask deborah to — we’re literally tracking hospitalization cases on a daily basis interacting with governors and health systems and that informs our supply chain decisions dr birx  yeah i really — i want to thank the health commissioners and all of them that have been sending hospital data  and i think it’s really critical and important to all of us new york city has been providing information new jersey connecticut rhode island and certainly louisiana in these hotspots  and that allows us — we can see where they are with the rising number of cases where they are in their curve what can be predicted and really ensuring that people get what they need as they need it and so i think many of the governors now and the health commissioners have been “i had to use ” — “i’m intubating  people a day now  i have enough for th next three days  if that doubles…we’re seeing our hospitalization rates stabilizing but we still think there will be this many more in the next days  that’s the information that they then translate into providing the ventilators so when you see the ventilator numbers going out they’re going out in  and   because i think early on we sent a big bolus out and then not all of them even today have been fully utilized and so we want to make sure every state and every hotspot can be reassured that ventilators are there for them as they move through the curve  and i think to date we’ve been able to do that  and i think that’s what’s important to me is that people have what they need when they need it  and to date people who have needed ventilators have been able to get on ventilators  and i think that’s our goal with governors and with the mayor to make sure that that continues to happen but that means all of us have to work together  and i think that’s what’s been really important over the last few weeks is people are not making generic requests anymore  they’re making datadriven requests because they know precisely what’s happening in their hospitals    dr birx when you are up here a little bit ago you talked about the curve and what you’re seeing and you’re concerned that people are not abiding by the social distancing guidelines  i mean you seemed in your voice to be quite concerned about that  has the curve changed enough at this point where that  to  people are likely to die  has that shifted upwards at all dr birx  no  it’s just when i look at what — so we’re in week  in our guidelines  and i guess what i expected when the president put out guidelines that said “don’t go to bars  don’t be in groups more than  people” when we said that now over  days ago that was serious  and then you could see what happened subsequently and you can see the number of individuals have been infected since then  because the people we’re seeing infected today and in hospitals today were infected after the guidelines went out so that’s what we’re worried about and we’re worried about that we’re not — we’re still in this and that’s why the president extended it for  days  but we have to get out of this  we have to start seeing this the president  but deborah aren’t you referring to just a few states  because many of those states are dead flat  i mean so — dr birx  yes the president  so it’s hard to get — it’s hard to be — dr birx  yes  there are states that are dead flat  but you know every — what changes the curve is a new detroit a new chicago a new new orleans a new colorado  those change the curves because it all of a sudden spikes with the number of new cases  because you have a certain projection of new cases and then a whole other city comes on top where they’re in their logarithmic phase so those ones that i talked about that had test results greater than  percent positive all of those — all of those states or all of those counties are in logarithmic phase  that means there are a lot of counties that aren’t and we are really — we’re excited about those counties that have been testing and still finding quite flat  and hopefully maybe sunday or so or sometime this weekend we can go through all the states and the curves again so you can see where you know that california and washington are still steady but we’re watching very carefully because we see that you can go from this to this very quickly  and what — this should not be happening any longer in new places if people are doing the social distancing washing their hands not getting together in large groups more than  the president  again so i look at the graphs all the time dr birx  yes you do the president  and you have many many — dr birx  yes the president  — flatliners  i call them “flatliners  i’m amazed at them  and you have a couple that are up it’s hard to blame the flatliners for not doing a good job dr birx  no no  i don’t want to say that  no  i don’t — no  thank you sir  i don’t want — in fact i want to praise the states that — and i think i want to be able to call them out and show you their graphs so you can see  they’ve had steady small cases  they’re testing and they’re doing a lot of testing  and their percent of testpositives are under  percent  i mean we have a whole group of states who are testing and their positivity rate is under  percent we know what it looks like on the logarithmic curve  you’re in the  percent then  percent then  percent and then  percent  that’s what we’re trying to prevent  and it’s the metro areas that are absolutely crucial in this  and so if you’re in a metro area or you’re in a small city please make sure all of your friends and family are following the guidelines  that’s the best thing we can do the president  no because i saw those pens going five minutes ago  they were so — they were thrilled  and the fact is — yes we compare them to italy  one place but we have many places that are — dr birx  yes the president  — really doing great  and i think that’s what deborah meant  she didn’t mean all of them  so when you write your story tomorrow maybe you’ll write it correctly  she was talking about one state  and another state is you know having a hard time  it’s — and they’re closely associated and by the way the people are doing a very good job including the people that live there  but when deborah was talking about italy she was talking about the one and then the other was lower  and then you have mostly states that have been unbelievable so she wasn’t talking about the average of everything she was talking about an individual state which is i think still better than italy  italy is having a hard time  by the way spain is having a hard time  france is having a hard time but our states generally speaking it’s like lots of different countries all over  we have — many of those countries are doing a phenomenal job  they’re really flat  and i think that’s what you meant dr birx  thank you sir the president  i don’t know i don’t want to — i don’t want to speak for — but i thought — that’s what i understood she meant yeah please    can i ask a question about that though  because coronavirus is present in all  states  you said before that you — when you implored mayors and governors to be serious about this you said “once it shows up mitigation efforts are too late” so how do you then square that with this notion that some states are doing well  i mean the virus doesn’t abide by state law the president  because some states they stay in better  they’re not touching  they’re not — whatever it is  they’re not going out  they’re not in groups  and some states are not probably as good or for whatever reason  or they also live a lot closer  you know new york is very dense and you know california is pretty dense too  and they’ve got a very good record going so far  we hope it doesn’t spike up but it’s very flat  we have states that are doing incredibly well  i mean when i looked at some of them i looked at some states that i would have thought maybe wouldn’t have done as well and they’re really flatlined  hope they stay that way  i hope they stay that way    isn’t that the point mr president the president  say it jeff    sir isn’t that the point that you want those states to stay flatlined the president  i want them — yeah that’s what i’m saying    i mean it seems like you’re — the president  no no no  but when deborah mentioned about italy and our country she wasn’t referring to our country she was referring to one state    but she’s encouraging people to do a better job of following these social distancing measures  that’s what i’m understanding it the president okay  so my understanding — i’m going to let her say it  but i think that everybody would have to be thrilled with the way most states are doing  thrilled    i don’t think she — is that what you meant the president  the flatline — the flatline states — states that have almost no bump  i mean i would think  now then you have others where for whatever reason they’re higher that’s different  but you can’t condemn people living in a flatliner with people living in something where there’s the big bump or the bigger bump or more akin to italy where they have some very unique problems  in all fairness to italy they have some very unique problems but if you’d like to come up and —    so how many flatline do we have the president  a lot of them    and how many do we have — how many  how many do we have dr birx  so why don’t i bring you the whole deck again and we’ll divide out the states so you can see them the vice president  we’ll do it tomorrow dr birx  because you really have to see each state separately  that’s why i started with there are states where you’ve heard me talk about how concerned i was  these are states that before the guidelines went out or right after the guidelines went out — i mean you can look at — it’s on the website if you go to the healthdataorg about when governors made clarity about closing their states as far as the social distancing the washing of the hands the bars the taking — doing takeout  and you can line that up with the presidential guidelines and not all states when the presidential guidelines came out immediately followed the presidential guidelines  not all states did  there are states that also may have gotten many more seeds from outside communities  that certainly is one of the issues that new york and new jersey connecticut and rhode island are facing  the virus came in from multiple places into those states  it was undetected early on and they have a very logarithmic curve what i am saying is even one of those curves in one county in one city is one curve too many  so i am passionate about everyone following the guidelines because of the outlier curves  maybe that was a better way of putting it the president  yeah  that’s exactly — dr birx  the outlier curves — the president  i think that’s perfect dr birx  — in specific counties is to make sure that doesn’t happen anywhere else    so would you feel better if every state did a stayathome order  would you feel better dr birx  well i think most of the states have done that  i think if you — one death from this is one death too many  i mean i come out of epidemics and pandemics  we know what to do  i know we don’t have a vaccine  and i know we don’t have a therapeutic  but we know what can be done and others are doing it and most of the people in the united states are doing it  it’s our communities — it’s every american that has to make these changes and i know they’re really hard and i know it’s hard to remember  i mean i have to say to myself every day because i’m around very important people to like never touch anything  and i’m just like paranoid now about touching things  i’m sure you all are too i mean we’ve gotten to the place where we don’t go to your places on pebble beach we go to the one that’s open aired because i mean you’re trying to protect your reporters  i mean i understand that  we’re all trying to protect each other and we all have to adapt to this new reality that we’re in right now and i believe everybody is trying really hard and i’m just asking them to try really really hard for these next  days because they will make a tremendous difference  we see that evidence  and so it’s like having a vaccine or a therapeutic because we know what works and we’re asking everybody to apply what works  and i know it takes amazing attention to detail because you know the minute you forget or do something you’re like “oh my gosh i should have never done that” and that’s the level of attention it takes    if covering our faces could help us do that and guidelines are coming out — the president  so i just want to say — look many states have started low and slow and then they stayed at a good level  some really stayed at a great level  some — louisiana as an example it was low and slow and they were looking great  i was watching it because you know it’s kind of a place people go to with mardi gras — which sort of is an interesting point because after mardi gras it was low and then all of a sudden it went up very rapidly  and now it’s one of our true hotspots right certain areas of michigan — detroit was — it looked like it was doing pretty good and then all of a sudden it went up  so you have that too but i’ll tell you what we have states that have been really incredible in the fact that they have kept so — so low they have not — you haven’t seen the bump and i hope you don’t  i hope you don’t  and you have a couple that for a lot of different reasons — and that’s not to blame anybody but they are at a higher level  but very few i think deborah — i mean i may say i think most people have actually followed the presidential — you can call them whatever you want  i would never use the word “dictates” because if i used that word i would be in such trouble  in fact you’ll put me in trouble just that i even mentioned the thought of it  okay  but we make a recommendation  and i think they’ve done a good job and maybe they started a little later but maybe they’re also more difficult states but we’ve done i think on average really phenomenally as a country  i think we’ve done phenomenally  because when you looked at that graph the other day — i don’t know if you saw it i assume you saw it  everybody in the world saw it  but you look at all those lines on the bottom — one color after another all different representing different states — it’s all crowded at the bottom  and then you had two that were up  but you had — i don’t know almost every one of them was down low  very low  so there were a lot of people listening and i just did — i want to be clear because i don’t need headlines tomorrow and neither does the country because i don’t want this country working so hard and then have press that is in this case maybe misinterpret something  because i might have — i might have — when i heard it i was surprised at first too but i understood what deborah meant    mr president —    can you clear something else up again the president  but i think it’s very important — because i think it’s very important for you to be accurate one other thing  just a quick thing  so what i found is when governors call me — i mean i think in every case they’ve always been so nice  so nice  and i’ve seen them and heard them say “thank you very much you have done a great job” “a fantastic job” in one case  “thank you  thank you  thank you  then i’ll see the governor usually of the opposite party  in almost all cases except maybe one — but in almost all cases they’re very generous they’re very nice  they thank me  everything is great  we’re doing a great job and then i’ll see them on television and just like a different person  and i realized there are some people because of politics that if they say “we want  ventilators” and i’ll say “no jim i want to give you  ventilators they’ll say “thank you  you are the greatest president that’s ever lived  and then i’ll see them quoted in a paper or see them on a show and they’ll say “the president didn’t come through for me  i’m very disappointed in the president” and we have a lot of that  they’re very happy when they talk to me and then i see them  but there are some people if they asked for  of something and if i gave them  they will say — you’ll say “how’s the president doing  “well we don’t like the job  to my face they’re very nice but then sometimes — i guess they assume i don’t watch them or something but i watch very closely yeah please    mr president one especially vulnerable population is the prison population and that’s — especially with jared here i wondered if you could address what the federal government is doing to protect inmates the president  well it’s vulnerable in that it’s close together really  i — i can’t tell you about age but a lot of young people in prison some people — some states — i have not done that at all but some states are letting people out of prison  some people are getting out that are very serious criminals in some states and i don’t like that  i don’t like it  but it’s a city or state thing in certain cases as you know  i think maybe philadelphia comes to mind  so we’ll see  you have to see what what’s going on  and we don’t like it  the people don’t like it  and we’re looking in to see if i have the right to stop it in some cases okay    mr president  million americans filed for unemployment last week  we haven’t heard you talk a lot today about what they’re going through  so what’s — the president  oh i think it’s —    — your message to them  and — the president  i think they’re going through  i think it’s terrible so look four weeks ago we had the greatest economy in the history of the world  the greatest in the world — greatest in the history of the world  we had the most jobs ever in the history of the united states  almost  million jobs right and then one day i get a call from deborah who’s fantastic and from dr fauci  and he said and she said “we have a problem  i said “what’s the problem  and they said “we may have to close it up  i said “close what up  they said “close up the country  and i said “what’s that all about  and we discussed today — and probably not since  we came to that conclusion — and she is a fantastic person a brilliant person and this is what she knows  i said “has it ever been this bad  and i think i can represent that you said “no  and part of it — it’s a contagion  it’s so contagious it’s like if you sneeze i probably get it  whoever heard of a thing like that  okay  and this very talented reporter is bailing out  okay  he’s out of here  i don’t blame you but it’s a very contagious thing and — probably the likes of which we’ve never seen in terms of that but  — so that’s over  years ago but that was — you know it’s been written about many many times  that was a horrible — whether it was  or  million people — i’ve heard from  to  i’ve heard  to  — but it was tens of millions of people now we have the advantage of communication  this could have been just as bad  i mean here we can read on the internet  we can see what to do  we can have these meetings they can watch on television which they do  a lot of people are watching  a lot of people are watching  and they say “gee social distancing” but in  they didn’t have that option  you know they didn’t know what to do  they just noticed people were dying all over the place  think of it  to  million people died  a lot of people in this country died i always — to me it’s a great — it’s a great question how come more people didn’t die in this country  and they say it actually started in this country and went to europe  i mean we lost a lot of people but relatively we lost very few compared to europe  so this is a terrible thing that happened and what’s happening now with people and jobs — so think of the position i’m in  we have built all together everybody — not me everybody — the greatest economy in history  and all of a sudden people come in that we respect and we know  and here’s the thing they were right  everybody questioned it for a while  not everybody but a good portion questioned it  they said “let’s keep it open  let’s ride it  if we did that — you saw the other graph  and whether it’s true or almost true or maybe not true enough — the number was  million people would have died   million people would have died in a short period of time  in fact the graph could have been even shorter  i always noticed that that horrible one — where it goes high — it actually comes down a little bit faster  it might have been over faster and you would have lost  million people so they come in and they say “we have to close up the country  and i say “you know what that does to this — to the fabric of this country to people that had great jobs great family no problems with money  their  — everything is perfect then all of a sudden they go from that to having no job in one day  they never even thought of it  and then you see  million people unemployed  unemployment numbers get released and you see  million people and it’s an artificial closing  it’s not like we have a massive recession or worse  it’s artificial because we turned it off  think of all we’re doing  we’re saying “don’t go to work and we’ll pay you  everything is the opposite  it was always “go to work and make a lot of money and do well and — the american dream  because of a hidden enemy we’re saying “don’t go to work and we’re going to pay you” look at the money  trillion  and we will probably do more  i think infrastructure would be a fantastic thing to do you want to get the restaurants back  you give deductibility  you understand what that is  you give deductibility for businesses where they go and they use the restaurants  the restaurants will be bigger and better than they were before  you know people don’t know a lot of restaurants closed when they ended deductibility  and then they started doing well but they had fewer restaurants  but the boom of the restaurants is when they had deductibility where corporations could use them  so — and entertainment  that was a great thing but they closed it and then they closed it again  and it wasn’t the same  but if you want to get them back you do that but infrastructure we borrow our money now at zero  you know if were paying  percent  percent  percent it’s a different ballgame  we’re borrowing — we can borrow long term for zero — literally zero you know that — because we’re considered the safe investment  all over the world they want money in the united states  that’s where they want the money so i know better than anybody  i just — i know what they’re going through and it’s horrible  but you know what i want to do  i want to be able to get them back fast  when this is over it’s going to be a day we’re going to celebrate because everyone is going to go to work and i think we’re going to have boom times  i think it’s going to be great and we’ve learned a lot  we’ve learned about borders  we’ve learned about reliance on other countries  we’ve learned so much — so much that i think we really have a chance to be bigger and better and stronger  and i think it’s going to come back very quickly but first we have to defeat this enemy so we will see you tomorrow  thank you very much  thank you end  pm edt      \n",

       "31  share share this page on facebook share this page on twitter copy url to your clipboard all news james s brady press briefing room pm edt the president i just had a meeting with kevin mccarthy future speaker of the house i hope and he ’ s done a fantastic job for the people of california and also the people of california have done a fantastic job when you look at the — at the bump you take a look at the bump and how they ’ re doing out there so i congratulate everybody out there but i thought i ’ d have kevin say a few word so kevin please leader mccarthy well thank you mr president and i would like to thank you on the basis of california governor newsom say the work that you ’ re doing together ha been — you ’ re working very closely — ha been effective in california a well — the vice president and the president you know today mr president i want to thank you especially for the work that secretary mnuchin ha done especially for small business just today alone i saw bank of america had more than loan in two hour and for anybody who ’ s in small business — my first small business wa when i wa year old you don ’ t have income coming in right now you get a loan but for your rent paying your employee and paying your utility is a grant that ’ s part of the care act and i think you ’ re going to find that a lot of small business are going to hire people back keep them afloat through the next two month and get this economy moving again a we get through this virus so i just want to thank you for all that work the president thank you great job you ’ re doing leader mccarthy thank you the president thank you you go ahead i ’ ll talk to you later okay thank you very much everybody and i want to start by saying that our heart go out to the people of new york a they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in america that seems to be the hotspot right now but you have some others a you know that are very — very bad very bad louisiana is getting hit very hard part of michigan are getting hit very very hard new jersey is — is –surprisingly it ’ s much greater than anybody would have thought they ’ re doing a really good job the governor is doing a really good job out there new york ’ s first responder emts doctor nurse are showing incredible courage under pressure they ’ re the best in the world we will take every action and we ’ ll spare no resource — financial medical scientific we will not spare anything we ’ ll get it back into shape the empire state — the governor is doing an excellent job they ’ re all working very hard together at the request of the governor a you know the javits center we have bed and we ’ re going to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be looked after the patient can be looked after that wa going to be for regular medical problem such a accident and you know it ’ s very interesting the governor is telling me we don ’ t have too many accident and very few people driving so we ’ re going to put that facility into play which is a big facility the ship will be staying the way it is but we ’ re putting that facility into play to help them and today also the cdc is announcing additional step american can take to defend against the transmission of the virus from recent study we know that the transmission from individual without symptom is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood so you don ’ t seem to have symptom and it still get transferred in light of these study the cdc is advising the use of nonmedical cloth face covering a an additional voluntary public health measure so it ’ s voluntary you don ’ t have to do it they suggested for a period of time but this is voluntary i don ’ t think i ’ m going to be doing it but you have a lot of way — you can look at it a follows the cdc is recommending that american wear a basic cloth or a fabric mask that can be either purchased online or simply made at home probably material that you ’ d have at home these face covering can be easily washed or reused i want to emphasize that the cdc is not recommending the use of medicalgrade or surgicalgrade mask and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard and doing some job medical protective gear must be reserved for the frontline healthcare worker who are performing those vital service the new mask guideline also do not replace cdc ’ s guidance on social distancing including staying in your home when possible standing at least six foot apart for a period of time again we ’ re going to all come back together here we ’ re going to all come back together and practicing hand hygiene which we should do anyway a lot of thing i think are going to spill over shaking hand maybe will stay with our country for a long time beyond this one of the — one of our great doctor wa telling me that — a you know we have flu every year and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial and said that if they didn ’ t shake hand that number would be substantially lower so maybe it ’ ll stay maybe some of these thing long term will be good but those guideline are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection so with the mask it ’ s going to be really a voluntary thing you can do it you don ’ t have to do it i ’ m choosing not to do it but some people may want to do it and that ’ s okay it may be good probably will they ’ re making a recommendation it ’ s only a recommendation it ’ s voluntary we ’ re also taking action to ensure the cost of no barrier to any american seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus the largest insurer nationwide the bluecross blueshield system ha now announced that it will not require any copays — which is really something that ’ s a tremendous statement — from patient of the virus treatment for the next day similar to the commitment of cigna humana anthem those are great company and they ’ re all doing the same thing so copays for them to do that is — it ’ s a big statement we appreciate it today i can so proudly announce that hospital and healthcare provider treating uninsured coronavirus patient will be reimbursed by the federal government using fund from the economic relief package congress passed last month so that wa a per the question yesterday and actually the day before yesterday this should alleviate any concern uninsured american may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment so that ’ s i think answer the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people i ’ m also signing a directive invoking the defense production act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supply by unscrupulous actor and profiteer the security and secretary — the secretary of homeland security will work with fema to prevent the export of respirator surgical mask glove and other personal protective equipment we need these item immediately for domestic use we have to have them but we ’ ve done really well with the purchase of item and you ’ ll be hearing about that shortly we ’ ve already leveraged the dpa to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supply under that authority this week the department of health and human service working with the department of justice took custody of nearly respirator surgical mask glove a well a bottle — many many many bottle — and disinfectant spray that were being hoarded all of this material is now being given to healthcare worker most of it ha already been given out and we ’ ve given a lot to new york a lot in new jersey a lot to other place in addition to ensure that healthcare worker in new york have the protective equipment they need the federal government in the name of the department of defense is providing about million respirator department of defense and we ’ ve already given of them to new york city mayor de blasio needed them very badly so we got them to mayor de blasio in new york city and they were very grateful million and we ’ re going to be increasing that number from million to more that ’ s a lot of respirator today my team spoke with the ceo of ochsner health and the ceo of lcmc the two largest health system in new orleans they said they feel that they currently have enough ventilator — i think a lot of people are going to have enough ventilator — and mask and appreciate what we did and all of the thing we ’ ve been doing with them working with them the ceo of ochsner warner thomas — who ’ s really been fantastic i have to say — indicated a need for surgical gown and i instructed fema to deliver them tomorrow so they ’ ll have the that ’ s louisiana — new orleans two hundred and thirty thousand surgical gown they ’ ll have them by tomorrow we ’ re expanding the role of the armed force in our response effort because no one is better prepared to win a war than the united state military and we are in a war the invisible enemy — remember over retired army medical personnel have answered their nation ’ s call and are now supporting field hospital and medical facility all across the country like what i just told you that governor cuomo requested we do something in javits where we take it over and we ’ re going to have that manned by the military because it ’ s very tough to get people — more people in the new york area so we ’ re going to have it manned by the military — javits center national guard member have been activated to help state build new treatment center and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supply that includes national guard the national guard is assisting very strongly because the state were in many case unable to have the delivery capability from warehouse and other place that we put the supply so i ’ ve given approval to use the national guard — the various national guard in the different state and they ’ re doing a fantastic job of not only protecting people but delivering material the army corp of engineer ha assessed more than facility in all state and is rapidly building temporary hospital and alternative care site in many state in new york new jersey michigan pennsylvania arizona california colorado florida illinois new mexico oregon washington wisconsin ohio they ’ re doing a lot of work in just those state plus additionals that are being — will be announced probably tomorrow but they ’ re doing some job the army corp of engineer — what a job they ’ re doing and fema — what a job they ’ re doing a we deploy the power of our military we ’ re also deploying the skill of our doctor scientist and medical researcher we continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapy and the treatment and prevention of the virus and we will keep the american people fully informed on our finding hydroxychloroquine — i don ’ t know it ’ s looking like it ’ s having some good result i hope that — that would be a phenomenal thing but we have it right now in — approximately now it ’ s increased to people i spoke with dr zucker in new york — terrific guy by the way he ’ s — we ’ re doing a good job and i spoke to governor cuomo last evening and this morning about it so it ’ s been there for about three and a half day but i think — and many other place it ’ s being tested too and we have a tremendous supply of it we ’ ve ordered it in the case that it work and it ’ s — it could have some pretty big impact and we ’ ll see what happens my administration is also working to get relief to american worker and business on day one of the paycheck protection program a kevin said more than billion in guaranteed loan have been processed to help small business keep their worker employed during the unprecedented time — this unprecedented time and bank of america ha been incredible of the big bank bank of america ha really stepped forward and done a great job and then you have the community bank your smaller bank and we ’ re already at billion going out to incredible people but that ’ s way ahead of schedule the sba and the treasury are working around the clock and our banking partner are really incredible and they ’ re ensuring that the money get to small business a quickly a possible and then the small business in turn take care of employee that they would have had to let go and now they ’ ll keep them and that ’ s good and then they ’ re going to open for business and they ’ re going to have their employee and we ’ ll try and get back to where we were eventually we ’ re going to supersede where we were the energy industry ha been especially hard hit in the crisis this afternoon i met with greg garland of phillips dave hager of devon energy harold hamm of continental resource jeff hildebrand of hilcorp energy vicki hollub of occidental petroleum mike sommers of the american petroleum institute kelcy warren of energy transfer partner mike wirth of chevron and darren wood of exxon mobil i informed them that we will be making space available in the strategic petroleum reserve to let american producer store surplus oil that can be sold at a later time there ’ s a tremendous abundance of oil primarily because of the virus the virus ha just stopped demand of everything including oil so we ’ re working with our great energy company these are great company they employ ten of thousand hundred of thousand of people and they ’ ve kept america really going for a long time and no big price hike no big anything i mean they ’ ve just kept it going and now they got hit but with all the job and all of the good that they do we ’ re going to make sure that they stay in good shape america is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the life of our citizen our future society our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time and we want them to stay healthy for a long time so stay at home this is ending this will end you ’ ll see some bad thing and then you ’ re going to see some really good thing and it ’ s not going to be too long we will heal our citizen and we will care for our neighbor and we will unleash the full might of the united state of america to vanquish the virus and with that i ’ d like to ask mike penny to come up vice president and say a few word and we ’ ll have a couple of other quick talk on a couple of subject and we ’ ll take question and it ’ s a beautiful friday in washington dc and our country is a great place and we ’ re getting better we ’ re getting better very quickly this wa artificially induced we just said — they said “ close it down you have to close it down we closed it down and we ’ re healing we ’ re going to get it better fast so mike if you could come up say a few word please the vice president thank you mr president the president just outlined a number of the decision that he made today on the unanimous recommendation to the white house coronavirus task force in addition some good news dr deborah birx will reflect on in a moment and some of the area across america where we see evidence that the mitigation effort — the american people putting into practice the president ’ s coronavirus guideline — are having a positive effect in fact today california and washington state where the coronavirus first emerged in our country remain — the case remain at a steady but low rate and we know a governor newsom said yesterday that they ’ re not out of the wood yet we continue to flow resource but we want to commend people in those state and all across the country who are putting into practice the social distancing and all the measure that state and local leader are advising and that — and that the president ha been advising in the coronavirus guideline for america we ’ re also continuing to track significant outbreak in new york state new orleans detroit chicago and boston and a the president indicated we ’ re prioritizing resource to support healthcare worker and to support those that are dealing with the coronavirus in those community on the subject of testing now more than million test have been performed across the country and a you all are aware some american have tested positive for the coronavirus abbott instrument which now can perform a test across the country have literally of their machine across the nation today but at the president ’ s direction fema is acquiring over more machine to distribute to every state public health lab in america and also to our indian healthcare service and the big news of course over the last few day wa that the fda — once again in near record time — ha approved an antibody test developed by cellex and we ’ re continuing on the white house coronavirus task force to examine way that we can scale up these rapid test and these innovative new test not just to meet this moment but to lay a foundation for testing across the nation in the month ahead a the president mentioned he met with energy executive today and continues to engage with leader of business all across the nation we also have held a teleconference today with commercial retailer on the president ’ s behalf we thanked them for the way that people that operate mall and shopping center around the country have embraced and enacted the coronavirus guideline for america it ’ s had enormous impact on their business and their industry but i heard — i heard from them their — their patriotic commitment to put the health of their associate and their customer first and it wa deeply inspiring on the subject of supply the president detailed our work in that space it continues to this day a part of our air bridge we had a flight arrive from china today to columbus ohio we continue to work each and every day watching the data about case to ensure that in particular not just the personal protective equipment is available for the healthcare worker that are on the frontlines but also that ventilator are available a the — a this epidemic make it way through region and community we are literally working hour by hour day by day to make sure that patient family and healthcare provider have the equipment and the support that they need a the president mentioned we ’ ve seen over a billion and a half dollar in loan go out through the paycheck protection program today we have available for question the head of the cdc today to speak about the new guidance on cloth face covering and secretary azar in a few moment will explain just how the president ’ s decision to make sure that no american will ever have to worry about paying for testing or for coronavirus treatment i ’ m pleased to report at the president ’ s direction medicaid and medicare already expanded to coronavirus treatment and testing early on and of course the president just indicated how major insurance company across the country are not just waiving copays on testing but they ’ re now waiving copays for at least day on any coronavirus treatment but now a secretary azar will enumerate now we ’ ll make sure that any american even those that have no insurance will be able to receive treatment in a hospital and never have to worry about the bill i ’ ll just give a general reminder to every american there is evidence across the country that you ’ re putting into practice the coronavirus guideline for america every american ha a role to play and i want to thank you on behalf of the president and all of the american people for the way that you ’ re stepping forward you ’ re engaging in the social distancing and doing the thing that will slow the spread we encourage you to keep on keeping on and we will get through this america we will get through the coronavirus to that day of renewed health and renewed prosperity that the president always describes but we ’ ll get through there sooner and we ’ ll get through there when we work together dr birx dr birx thank you mr vice president mr president thank you for your word of discipline and determination i guess that really describes what we ’ re asking every american to really be disciplined about these guideline and really determined to stay in that space of execution you know we are just in week three on — of this full guidance measure we really do appreciate the work of the citizen of california and washington state because we do see that their curve is different their curve is different from new york new jersey and connecticut and we really believe that the work that every citizen is doing in those state is making a difference and it will make a difference for the frontline healthcare provider we also are deeply grateful despite the way their curve look today they continue to get ready for a different potential so that they can ensure that patient if they do get sick have option and availability to all the frontline healthcare worker in the — what we have referred to a “ hot zone ” — area where the number of case are quite significant — the new orleans the new york city metro area including new jersey and connecticut — the incredible work that the frontline healthcare worker are providing we ’ re really working now at a much more granular level talking directly to hospital to ensure that they have the supply that they need in coordination with state and local government and to work — i think we discussed it yesterday but i think it wa quite clear also — and reiterated by governor cuomo today — that we have to support one another a each of these different metro area and other area move through their peak of new infection when we talked about it at the beginning of this week we talked about this week and next week being incredibly difficult and we want to recognize the number of american who have lost their life to this virus and recognize the sacrifice that healthcare provider are making both in their care but i think i ’ m very uplifted by hearing their message to family and their compassion for others to provide that kind of support to the individual in the hospital we continue to watch in addition the chicago area the detroit area and have some developing concern around colorado the district of columbia and pennsylvania so a you can see each of these will follow their own curve we ’ ll be getting more and more of those case over time information in a very granular way to each and every one of you so that we can follow these epidemiologic curve a each of these state county and community move through this together in solidarity and really ensuring that we can move supply creatively around the country to meet the need of both the frontline healthcare provider but also every american who need our support right now thank you the president thank you very much secretary azar well thank you mr president for your continued leadership a we battle the coronavirus first i want to thank all of the member of the hhs team and the frontline healthcare worker across america including those who — those service worker who serve in our hospital at our healthcare facility those who clean those who deliver those who stock the shelf — all those who are going into battle every day against the virus your country ha asked you to serve a never before and you have responded heroically i ’ m going to provide a brief update on the administration ’ s plan to cover the testing and treatment for the uninsured getting the uninsured access to the care they need is a top priority for president trump we are already rolling out the billion in funding from the family first coronavirus response act to cover provider ’ expense for testing and diagnosing the uninsured the care act signed by the president includes another billion for healthcare provider under the president ’ s direction we will use a portion of that funding to cover provider ’ cost of delivering care for the uninsured sending the money to provider through the same mechanism used for testing a a condition of receiving fund under this program provider will be forbidden from balance billing the uninsured for the cost of their care provider will be reimbursed at medicare rate we will soon have more specific on how the rest of the billion

trying different experimental therapy and we need a much data a we can collect a quickly a possible on how these treatment are working today oracle ha developed and is donating to the government and the american people a web portal and platform to gather crowdsourced realtime information from provider about how patient respond to potential therapeutic while this doesn ’ t replace the important work of clinical trial it give u data rapidly if you are a doctor or a healthcare provider and you would like to help u you can sign up today to begin reporting on your work there ’ s a special registration page for provider at thank you very much the president thank you very much okay let ’ s go steve if we could draw you out a little bit more on the advice on face mask what do — what would people gain from wearing a mask and why are you opposed to wearing one yourself the president well i just don ’ t want to wear one myself it ’ s a recommendation they recommend it i ’ m feeling good i just don ’ t want to be doing — i don ’ t know somehow sitting in the oval office behind that beautiful resolute desk — the great resolute desk — i think wearing a face mask a i greet president prime minister dictator king queen i don ’ t know somehow i don ’ t see it for myself i just — i just don ’ t maybe i ’ ll change my mind but this will pas and hopefully it ’ ll pas very quickly now with that being said if somebody want to — i mean most people can just make something out of a certain material so it ’ s very well designated it ’ s very simple to do i won ’ t be doing it personally it ’ s a recommendation okay and would you like to say something about that surgeon general adam sure absolutely the president surgeon general please surgeon general adam well thank you mr president mr vice president mr secretary and cdc director redfield i especially want to thank the folk at the cdc and it ’ s a great question that you ask it ’ s a fair question that you ask i want to unpack the evolution of our guidance on mask because it ha been confusing to the american people first of all i want people to understand that the cdc the world health organization my office and most public health and health organization and professional originally recommended against the general public wearing mask because based on the best evidence available at the time it wa not deemed that that would have a significant impact on whether or not a healthy person wearing a mask would contract we have always recommended that symptomatic people wear a mask because if you ’ re coughing if you have a fever if you ’ re symptomatic you could transmit disease to other people what ha changed in our recommendation well it ’ s important to know that we now know from recent study that a significant portion of individual with coronavirus lack symptom they ’ re what we call asymptomatic and that even those who eventually become presymptomatic meaning that they will develop symptom in the future can transmit the virus to others before they show symptom this mean that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity for example coughing speaking or sneezing even if those people were not exhibiting symptom in light of this new evidence cdc recommends and the task force recommends wearing cloth face covering in public setting where other social distancing measure are difficult to maintain these include place like grocery store and pharmacy we especially recommend this in area of significant communitybased transmission it is critical and the president mentioned this the vice president mentioned this it ’ s critical to emphasize that maintaining six foot of social distancing remains key to slowing the spread of the virus but cdc is additionally advising the use of simple cloth covering to slow the spread of the virus and to help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others the cloth face covering recommended are not surgical mask or respirator those are critical supply that must continue to be reserved for healthcare worker and other medical first responder a recommended by the current cdc guidance a the president also mentioned cloth face covering fashioned from household item or made at home from common material at low cost can be used a an additional voluntary public health measure this recommendation complement and doe not replace the president ’ s coronavirus guideline for america “ day to slow the spread ” which remains the cornerstone of our national effort to slow the spread of the virus cdc is always — always looking at the data we told you that from the beginning — dr birx say it every single press conference — we ’ re looking at the data we ’ re evolving our recommendation and new recommendation will come a the evidence dictate so i want to say if you do choose to wear a face mask — very important — wash your hand first because you don ’ t want to put on a face covering with a dirty hand do not touch your face while you are wearing the face covering because again you could take material from the surface germ from the surface and bring it to your face if you choose to wear a face covering please — please leave the mask the medical supply for the medical professional healthcare worker and frontline worker know that this is not a substitute for social distancing and remember this is all about me protecting you and you protecting me this is about u coming together a community and if people voluntarily choose to wear a face covering they ’ re wearing it to protect their neighbor from getting the coronavirus because again they could have asymptomatic spread so mr president thank you very much for that the president thank you thank you surgeon general adam appreciate the opportunity to update everyone the president great job thank you okay jon mr president dr fauci last night recommended — said that every state should have stayathome order right now do you agree with that should every state in this country have the kind of stayathome order that we now see in place like washington and new york the president i leave it up to the governor the governor know what they ’ re doing they ’ ve been doing a great job i guess we ’ re close to percent anyway and the state that we ’ re talking about are not in jeopardy no i would leave it to the governor i like — i like that from the standpoint of governing and i like that from the standpoint of even our constitution please mr president to address the shortage in the blood supply the food and drug administration announced yesterday — the president well i pointed to him right thanks mr president the president i knew we inaudible i heard a different voice i heard a different voice go ahead we ’ ll get you later going to the oil meeting previously — the president yeah — is the u willing to cut domestic oil production what came out of the meeting what wa the consensus the president well a lot of thing came out it ’ s a great industry it ’ s an important industry it ’ s a tremendous jobproducing industry and it ’ s just vital and it wa also very interesting because they all were given the test before they came into the room so you have the head of exxon mobil you have all these guy taking the test and they all passed with flying color so that wa good they left happy in that respect at least there ’ s just an overabundance of oil right now — oil and gas tremendous overabundance and it wa caused — they were doing a great job they were producing a lot of energy but then you have the virus come along and it knocked another percent maybe percent off of the market so there ’ s too much oil there ’ s a glut and these are great company and they ’ ll figure it out it ’ s free market we ’ ll figure it out you spoke to president putin i mean what ’ s on the table here with him — the president and with the crown prince both yeah the president they were having a competition we ’ ll see how it all work out i think it ’ s going to work out very well it ’ s going to take a long time to — to get rid of that there ’ s massive excess amount of oil and gas massive like probably there ’ s never been so where that doe work out well i guess you could say is for driver i think in certain location it ’ s down to and cent a gallon right now on the road but we have a tremendous industry a great industry a tremendously important industry from the standpoint of job and we ’ re energy independent we have to make sure we keep it that way all right please go ahead mr president a i wa saying the food and drug administration to address the shortage of blood supply announced yesterday it would ease the restriction on certain donor including gay men who are now required to be abstinent for month a opposed to month to donate did you have a hand in that change the president no i didn ’ t know anything about that that wa done by the fda — very capable people at the fda please go ahead yes mr president both the government of canada and are pushing back on this dpa not to export respirator the president yeah say — the president i don ’ t blame them they can push back if they want yeah but they ’ re saying — the president we ’ re not happy with we ’ re not happy and the people that dealt with it directly are not at all happy with so we ’ ll see whether or not we do i heard what he had to say today i don ’ t know the gentleman but we ’ re not happy with go ahead and where is dr fauci the president i don ’ t know but every time you ask that question — whenever he ’ s not here you look you say “ where is he and you ’ ll say “ is there a problem no problem whatsoever every time he ’ s not here — sometimes i ’ ll ask him to come because that ’ s the first question that you and a couple of others from the fake news establishment ask is “ where is dr fauci we ’ re doing great together a different subject if i may ask the president except we ’ re covering a different subject today go ahead a different subject if i may ask the president go ahead jim try another one mr president you have you have said nobody could have seen this pandemic coming but in fact secretary azar at a biodefense summit in april of said “ of course the people ” — “ of course the thing that people ask ‘ what keep you most up at night in the biodefense world ’ pandemic flu of course i think everyone in this room probably share that concern your own health and human service secretary wa aware that this had the potential of being a very big problem around the world a pandemic of this nature who dropped the ball the president well i always knew that pandemic are one of the worst thing that could happen there ’ s been nothing like this since probably that wa the big one in europe it started actually here and went to europe probably i ’ ve heard about — you ’ ve also said nobody could see this coming the president excuse me wait a minute let me finish i ’ ve heard about this for a long time — pandemic you don ’ t want pandemic and i don ’ t think he wa talking about a specific pandemic he wa talking about the threat of a pandemic could happen and it could happen most people thought it wouldn ’ t and most people didn ’ t understand the severity of it this is a very severe what ’ s happened is very severe but i ’ d let you answer that i assume that he wa talking about the concept of a pandemic secretary azar thank you mr president actually — absolutely for year now this country ha had a massive effort at the federal state and local level of preparedness for a pandemic now that largely ha been a i said in those remark about pandemic flu preparedness we knew about sars we knew about mers which were earlier modification or variant of the coronavirus none of those achieved anything like what we ’ re seeing today but that ’ s why for successive presidency including the leadership of president trump there ha been a great focus on pandemic preparedness in fact it wa just in november i believe that the president signed the pandemic flu preparedness executive order that we have — and we have also updated the pandemic crisis action plan which ha been the playbook from which we ’ ve been working the pandemic flu plan again the action plan from which we have been working that coordinate the wholeofgovernment wholeofeconomy approach here so we ’ ve all been very focused on pandemic preparedness that ’ s what we do but this particular strain of pandemic who would — who would have known this particular strain but secretary azar if you were preparing for a pandemic if this government were preparing for a pandemic why is it we don ’ t have enough mask why is it we don ’ t have enough medical equipment in this country the president previous administration gave u very little ammunition for the military and very little shelf space let me just tell you — but you ’ ve been president — the president you know it — you ’ ve been president — the president you know the answer — three or four year now the president the previous administration the shelf were empty the shelf were empty you had time to stock the shelf the president so what you should do is speak to the people from the previous administration jim and ask them that question because — mr president you ’ ve been in office — the president — the shelf were empty — for almost four year the president and you know what else the military shelf were also empty we had no ammunition literally and that wa said by one of your favorite general “ we have — sir we have no ammunition guess what we had very little medical supply also all right go ahead please isn ’ t that a copout though the president go ahead isn ’ t that a copout the president we ’ ll get it back we ’ ll get you back but mr president — the president we ’ ll get you back please but what about that question — the president jim i said we ’ ll get you back please go ahead so i want to ask about the dpa so you said that there will be a ban on exporting of all — what doe it cover so mask glove what else is included in that order the president it cover everything and are you concerned — the president but if somebody ordered — if italy if spain who ha big problem — these have — these are country with tremendous problem — france if they ordered — if they have longterm order and they ’ re in in there and they want to get certain thing i ’ ve let them go out in certain instance because i think it ’ s only fair they have problem that are proportionately or relatively bigger than our problem so if they ordered something and they ’ re waiting for a an example mask made here and going to italy i ’ m not going to be stopping that i think it would be very unfair and by the way speaking about being fair and unfair two very big cruise liner a you know i allowed them to dock today we worked with the governor of florida a you know ron desantis and we worked on it and we had tremendous security and we took the sick people and we ’ re working with them we have doctor we have great doctor military doctor and from a humane standpoint not that we ’ re in love with this — these are two massive ship — but we have to take care of people we have to take care we sent many back to canada the canada — the canadian came and worked very closely with u a did the uk we had a lot of people from the uk and we take — we took care of the american we took care of the sick we had some people very sick i think we have three to four maybe five people that had died on the boat one of the boat actually and we had to take care of these people so we couldn ’ t let them float aimlessly into the ocean looking for port a they ’ ve been doing for a long time and i made the decision we had to take them in and homeland security and a lot of other people did a great job but we had to help people these are people that were very very sick some were dying some died please mr president on dpa — can i just finish please the president go ahead yeah go ahead mr president your staff they said that people in close proximity to you and the vice president will get a coronavirus test i ’ m wondering are you concerned that the people you ’ ve been hanging around with may have the virus the president no i ’ m not concerned no i had a test yesterday but what ’ s the reason for the order for people who meet with you or talk to you why should they require coronavirus testing the president i don ’ t know i mean i just — i heard from the oil executive these are people — most of them had not had the test and frankly i think they left the room feeling good about a lot of thing but they felt good about the test this wa a test that took i guess minute to have it finalized they took the test i don ’ t know i didn ’ t know they were doing that maybe they did it just for them i don ’ t know but — but they ’ re always going to have to have a test the president — it seems that a lot of people — because now we have test that really work well abbott in this case abbott we have other test being developed right now that are also fantastic the original test — the one we inherited jim a an example they were — they were broken they were obsolete they were not good test and that ’ s what we got stuck with we ’ ve developed some incredible test but this took to minute and they were all fine on the dpa sir — the president go ahead finish — finish your question thank you yeah so the problem some people have raised is that if the u stopped exporting what you could have is other country then deciding reciprocally that they are going to stop exporting — the president sure — and that the result of that then will be a net decrease in the amount of supply that american doctor american hospital have how do you address that the president well i address it in the following manner we really are very well supplied we are not the principal — it ’ s the hospital the state the city they ’ re supposed to get everything they can and stock up in case something like this happens but nobody could ever have assumed that something like this happened so we started supplying we brought tremendous amount to new york today and over the last few day we brought them to louisiana we brought them to michigan we brought them to los angeles a lot of equipment you ’ ve read the amount of mask that we had i think i said over million mask the mask the you know more expensive more complicated better whatever mask — the one they want to use in the hospital we have million of them now and we ’ ve given them to a lot we sent to bellevue in new york today — that wa for mayor de blasio — of them but we have million we ’ re going to have more than that and we ’ re getting them from various source including the military we ’ re rapidly then replacing them because we have to replace them in case there ’ s a — another emergency i would be — gown too we have many gown being delivered and have been delivered our people have done an incredible job most people have said — now and i said this yesterday — governor have said “ thank you very much great job if they ’ re a democrat governor — in some case not in all case at all — if i said “ here ’ s ventilator how many do you want “ we want “ here ’ s you got ’ em but you know what we ’ re going to do we ’ re going to add another is that good they said “ wow that ’ s great and then if jim acosta go and say “ are you happy with the president “ no he should have given u that ’ s what ’ s happening you know why because that ’ s a standard political answer and that ’ s a shame because we have done a job like nobody ha ever done a job but we ’ ve just delivered a lot of mask we ’ ve just delivered a lot of gown and protective gear but you know you ’ re talking about a massive — you ’ re talking about a massive number but a of this morning people were very very happy steve did oil executive ask you for a bailout of any sort the president no they didn ’ t ask for a bailout no what did they ask for the president it wa really more of a discussion than asking we discu — you know we did discus the concept of tariff because a you know this wa a dispute among a couple of country that i think they want to be able to get it solved they had a dispute they had a competition but they want to get it resolved russia — you mean tariff — tariff on — the president — and saudi arabia i think want to get it — — saudi and russia the president yeah i think they want to get it resolved i think they ’ re working very hard i mean they told me they want to get it resolved they ’ re working very hard go ahead president trump thank you yesterday jared kushner said the notion of the federal stockpile wa it ’ s supposed to be “ our ” stockpile it ’ s not supposed to be state stockpile that they then use what did he mean by “ our ” and — the president well why don ’ t you ask him and even the fact that taxpayer from every state pay for it — the president what ’ s that a “ gotcha ” “ i gotcha you used the word “ our ” no it ’ s not a “ gotcha what did he mean by it the president “ our ” — you know what “ our ” mean united state of america that ’ s what it mean it mean — so it mean the state the president our our it mean the united state of america and then we take that “ our ” and we distribute it to the state so why did he say it ’ s not supposed — the president not that we have to — — to be state stockpile that they then can use the president because we need it for the government and we need it for the federal government to give to the state the president but when the state are in trouble — no to also keep — then who are you giving to if it ’ s not to the state the president to keep — to keep for our country because the federal government need it too not just the state but out of that we oftentimes choose — a an example we have almost ventilator and we are ready to rock with those ventilator we ’ re going to bring them to various area of the country that need them but when he say “ our ” he ’ s talking about our country he ’ s talking — but he make the distinction the president excuse me and sir — the president he ’ s talking about the federal government i mean it ’ s such a basic simple question and you try and make it sound so bad it ’ s not bad i ’ m just trying to — the president you ought to be — you ought to be ashamed of yourself — understand no — by the way secretary azar — the president you know what you ought to be ashamed it ’ s such a simple question he said “ our and “ our ” mean for the country and “ our ” mean for the state — but then he said it ’ s not supposed to be state stockpile the president — because the state are part of the country don ’ t make it sound bad don ’ t make it sound bad go ahead steve go ahead back here but mr president the hhs even changed the language on the website the president you just asked your question you just asked your question in a very nasty tone i don ’ t think it wa nasty the president let ’ s go i think you didn ’ t give me an answer the president please mr president — the president i gave you a perfect answer you know it go ahead well just to follow up on that when we have the federal stockpile — i mean isn ’ t that designed to be able to distribute to the state who need it the president sure but it ’ s also needed for the federal government we have a federal stockpile and they have state stockpile and frankly they were — many of the state were totally unprepared for this so we had to go into the federal stockpile but we ’ re not an ordering clerk they have to have for themselves now some of the state were in good shape some of the state were not in good shape that ’ s probably something you could expect we have been helping state we have been spending a tremendous amount of time effort and billion and billion of dollar on making sure that they have what they have i mean take new york we built them hospital — i built them four hospital — built them medical center sent a ship with room and operating room and then on top of that gave vast number of ventilator and vast number of surgical gown equipment mask everything else now they had a chance to order ventilator over the year they had a chance to order a very big — but they didn ’ t choose to do it we were there and we helped them and i think the governor of new york is very thankful for the help that we gave but we have a stockpile it ’ s a federal stockpile we can use that for state or we can use it for ourselves we do use it for the federal government we have a very big federal government go ahead so have you decided not to use your power to be essentially a traffic cop for all the essential medical supply that are needed in this the president well we ’ re not a traffic cop we ’ re a humanitarian cop we help — it ’ s like the ship do you think we wanted to take two big ship into our country that have obvious problem and you know the problem i ’ m talking about so i have a decision to make do i take them in or do i save life okay do i take them in or do i save i decided to take them in and we have tremendous protection we have great doctor there to help the people they had four or five people that died that wa a of last night they died on the ship we took care of it and now the people are in the process of — and many are already back in canada they ’ re back in the uk — united kingdom and many of them were american citizen some were very sick we ’ re taking care of the sick people we ’ re testing all of the others very very carefully — very very carefully they are being tested like you wouldn ’ t believe and we solve a humanitarian catastrophe you know why because nobody else would take the ship nobody else would take them so we docked him in i think fort lauderdale i think some people are wondering why you don ’ t say “ we ’ re the federal government and there ’ s a shortage of mask and other thing and — the president we do say that — we ’ re going to — the president we do say that — sign off on every single shipment– the president we say we ’ re — we say and use the act — that need to go to place where it need to go ” the president excuse me we do say that and we use the act and we ’ ve used it a number of time very powerfully and a lot of time we don ’ t have to use it because we say “ we ’ re going to use it if you don ’ t do this or that ” and then we also have company that act incredibly well we have plenty of them — mostly them but we ’ ve used the act very powerfully and a lot of time you don ’ t have to exercise the act all you have to do is tell them “ look if you don ’ t do this we ’ re going to use the act ” and we ’ ve done a good job with it — maybe a great job yeah mr president there are news report that you want to sign the stimulus check that are going out here in several month is that right do you want to sign those check the president no me sign no there ’ s million of check i ’ m going to sign them no it ’ s a trump administration initiative but do i want to sign them no the people are getting — the people are getting their money there ’ s a lot of stimulus going in a lot of different way there ’ s also stimulus going for company that would — if it weren ’ t our government would not — and some company that were very strong a month ago again we had the strongest economy in the world we had our best ever we had probably the best economy in the history of the world bigger than china bigger than anybody and one day we have to say “ close it up stop everybody go home and you know what that ’ s pretty tough to do that that ’ s another thing — that there are rumor that these check may not go out for another four month like if you don ’ t have a direct deposit the president i don ’ t know all i can tell you is the small business today is — we ’ re way ahead of schedule there is a problem where — and — which i pointed out i said “ you shouldn ’ t do it this way ” — with unemployment where equipment by the state we ’ re sending the money to the state once the money is sent to the state then the state whether they ’ re republican or democrat have to get the money out to the people hopefully they ’ ll be able to do it but many of those state have computer i don ’ t know that they ’ re equipped i wanted to give them money direct if that ’ s what you ’ re talking about i wanted to give the money out direct it would have been much easier but the democrat and some people said “ no let ’ s do it the complicated way ” i ’ m talking more about the stimulus check the — like — the president all right well i wa talking about — — when will people get their money the president excuse me i wa talking about both yeah when will people get that money the president yeah they ’ ll get it they will go ahead please thank you sir i ’ d like to ask question both for myself and some of the other reporter who aren ’ t in the room social distancing the president sure first of all — and this is for yourself and dr birx what percentage of the population do we suspect to be asymptomatic at this point is there a way to figure that out it seems like the antibody test might be able to assist in determining that number the president go ahead deborah dr birx yeah thank you so while we ’ re working diligently in the midst of the crisis to make sure that the healthcare worker and everyone who is sick get provided for at the same time we ’ re working on test and assay that will be critical for surveillance and at the same time working on plan for what we need to do a this move through the population and we get on the downside where we ’ re sort of — we ’ re not there yet and hopefully most of the state will — say like california and washington and then what we need to do to be prepared for fall so all three of those thing are happening simultaneously and there ’ s people working on each one of those work stream the antibody piece is critical a you described because at this time we can ’ t — if we have — let ’ s say asymptomatic status is inversely — symptomatic status is inversely related to age and so the younger you are the more likely you are to be asymptomatic we have to know that because we have to know how many people have actually become infected so when we talked about five day ago — i think on monday — i called on university to work on an elisabased test to test for their health worker and really get through that at the same time the private sector is working on test and what do we want those test to be we want those test to be like what we use for hiv and malaria — finger prick onto a cassette you get a line if you ’ re positive and you get a control line negative the line isn ’ t there and there ’ s the control line that ’ s what — that ’ s our dream assay because it ’ s a finger prick in the meantime we ’ re not waiting i mean we ’ re pushing for that at the same time we ’ re asking to develop an assay — the elisabased assay which requires a tube of blood and that ’ s why we ’ re also talking about could we use dried blood spot we also put out a call directly out to the military because of the roosevelt to really test all of the sailor on the roosevelt with an antibody test to get to this critical issue of asymptomatic and already preexisting antibody that would be — if the first responder knew they already had had it and they had protective antibody if the nurse knew the doctor knew if your schoolteacher knew then it ’ s a very different dialogue so we understand the importance of that and we understand how important it is in relationship to understanding this epidemic one other comment because i know we ’ re always saying “ who knew what when i just want to make clear there ’ s country working on this collectively together it ’ s devastating for every single country when we get through this we can go back and look at what happened where and what doe this epidemic look like and when you get through it then you can validate every model there is known to man when you ’ re in the middle of it you have to concentrate on serving the need of each american and what that need look like at the same time you have these other work stream on surveillance and how to be prepared both scientifically and therapeutically and vaccinewise for the next fall if it happens again so i think these thing are happening together but i just want u to really concentrate on the fact that all around the globe country after country is dealing with this and we can talk about “ why didn ’ t italy do something or spain do something or germany do something or we can really say “ right now we all can we can do something we can do the social distancing and all of the piece that we know is starting to work around the globe in country after country and then when we get through all of this we can ask the question about “ could we have done some piece of this better a a global community ” i will remind you that on february the head of the who said there wa no reason to ever do a travel ban you know it wasn ’ t until january that we knew that there wa humantohuman transmission remember — dr birx the president wa saying this wa going to go away it ’ s april the president it is going to go away it is going away the president — but mr president you said it wa going to go away in april the president it ’ s going — i didn ’ t say a date you said “ when it warmed up in april… ” the president i said it ’ s going away and it is going away okay are you — dr birx — dr birx yes thank you sir but — if i ’ m — the president okay that wa a good answer to your question no no no no no no more that wa a long but a very good answer that wa enough for you i have a question on the insurance inaudible coverage mr president on the insurance coverage for treatment the way your government is going is trying to make sure that people are covered on the treatment for covid — the president yeah we ’ re going to do that doe that include the million people who are in this country illegally are they going to be covered a well the president we ’ ll be talking about that at a different time yeah please go head yes mr president will you release — authorize the release of the underlying data for the conclusion of the to people succumbing perhaps dr birx can talk — the president well that ’ s up to dr birx you ’ ll decide a to when — dr birx we can release all of the — i — some disease expert have expressed concern that they haven ’ t seen the underlying data they ’ re not questioning — the president i ’ m sure they ’ ll talk to you about that and dr fauci too please go ahead thank you mr president this is for you and secretary azar ten million people say they ’ ve lost their job in the past two week so how is this stimulus money for free treatment going to absorb the new number of uninsured and — the president go ahead if you want — go ahead — would it not be easier to reopen the obamacare market or expand medicaid secretary azar so for an individual who had employer insurance — that ’ s what i mentioned in my remark — if you were employed and had insurance through your employer and you ’ ve now lost your job and lost that insurance you now do have a special enrollment period where you may enroll in the individual exchange of the affordable care act so that ’ s — that ’ s existing law then what we ’ re doing is taking from that hundred billion dollar to provider taking money and saying “ if you ’ re a provider and you care for anybody who is uninsured we ’ re going to compensate you for doing that and we ’ re going to compensate you at the medicare reimbursement rate and you are not allowed to bill that uninsured individual anything ” so in many respect it ’ s better for those uninsured individual they ’ re going to get firstdollar coverage they ’ re going to get care in the united state and the provider is going to be made whole from this program so it ’ s really an unprecedented — what president trump is doing here with this money is an unprecedented diseasespecific support of care for individual to make sure that people get treatment will someone still be billed if they test negative or what about noncovid condition so i just have a couple of question about supply — one specifically on new york and the question of ventilator governor cuomo is saying that new york may be day away from running out of ventilator can you assure new york that going into next week that they ’ re going to have the ventilator that they ’ re going to need the president no they should ’ ve had more ventilator at the time they should have had more ventilator they were totally under serviced we are trying to do — we ’ re doing our best for new york you know we have — we have state we have a lot of state we have territory too but we have a lot of state that have to be taken care of some much more so than others we ’ ve worked very well with the governor we happen to think that he ’ s well served with ventilator we ’ re going to find out but we have other state to take care of we have a big problem in louisiana we have a big problem in michigan we have a big problem in seven other really strong hotspot but we ’ re doing the best we can i wish they did the original order three year ago they would ’ ve had all the ventilator they needed although even then they wouldn ’ t because if you look at what the original request wa from new york it wa far greater than anybody ever heard and we ’ ve — we ’ ve supplied a lot i told you we supplied some just today to new york and we supplied some yesterday to new york city did you have one in the back yeah please mr president if i can say — this is why the question about the stockpile that wa asked earlier is so important the president i don ’ t think that wa the question inaudible no it wa a very important question because what jared kushner said yesterday is that the federal stockpile is for use by the federal government not for the state to have access to so you seem to be saying different so did jared kushner misspeak yesterday the president no no he didn ’ t — he didn ’ t misspeak is that federal stockpile available to the state the president he used the word “ our okay “ our ” — “ our ” is referring to our country yeah but he said — he said it ’ s not for the state to use the president the state to the best of my knowledge and to the best of your knowledge are a part of our country we are taking what is in the federal stockpile and we are helping state all over the country but we also want to keep some because when that surge come when you hit those peak we ’ re going to need it and we have to be able to have the flexibility to take those ventilator and bring them to louisiana new york detroit different place that ’ s all but you will be using them for the state that need them the president oh of course we ’ re not using them anywhere else we ’ re not going to be using them jon anywhere else but we want the flexibility because you know we don ’ t even know when the surge is coming but it ’ s coming soon and it ’ s going to be big and some area won ’ t have it some area will be pleasantly surprised just like we ’ ve been you look at the chart state that i thought would have been maybe a disaster turned out to be — really they ’ ve done a great job some state are really troubled but you don ’ t know you don ’ t know we have great flexibility i would have preferred giving them all out we ’ d have nothing and now when we have a surge we can ’ t get them back from where we gave them because it ’ s very tough to take it back so we have tremendous flexibility and it could be new york it could be louisiana those are two that are really rough new jersey is very rough and they ’ ve done a very good job in new jersey but new jersey is very rough go ahead please in the back yes the question or — the question is about the cdc guideline i know that they changed over time from february and there is — the president the guideline relative to which — the mask for instance social distancing and the number of people who can gather in a group and so on and now we have this — this measure about wearing mask and i know you told steve about why you don ’ t want to wear a mask but i ’ m just wondering if you can tell u more about why because it would set — the president i ’ m just don ’ t choose to — an example the president they ’ re not mandatory guideline they ’ re guideline they suggest you could wear them you don ’ t have to wear them in fact the director is here if you want to say a couple of word about it you don ’ t — you can if you want you don ’ t have to but what i ’ m really inaudible your decision not to wear one the president but basically it ’ s — it ’ s a voluntary thing say it director he ’ s doing a good job dr redfield thank you very much i think i just want to reemphasize — i ’ ve said this before — that we ’ re not defenseless against this virus we have a powerful tool a powerful weapon that is social distancing and we ’ ve continued to embrace that with the president ’ s initiative to slow the spread of coronavirus we ’ re constantly looking at new data and a the surgeon general said one of the new information that became more clear to all of u is there ’ s a greater number of people that are asymptomatically infected than we previously thought a ambassador birx said that may be inversely related to age and so really the purpose here is first and foremost to embrace the social distancing that ’ s the number one thing that ’ s the powerful weapon and you know this virus ha a great weakness it can ’ t jump from one person to another if it ’ s got to swim more than six foot and this is why we really want that that said we now know that there may be individual in signif — area of significant community transmission that may be asymptomatically infected and we know that a face barrier can actually interrupt the number of virus particle that can go from one person to the other so a wa said by the vice president this is — and the president — the purpose of this face covering is to be another adjunctive mitigation strategy to protect someone from spreading the virus from themselves to someone else the president and i wa just tested also so i assume i don ’ t know have the virus so i don ’ t have to worry about spreading it okay please go ahead mr president i want to make sure we ’ re clear when you mentioned tariff earlier — the president yeah — that came up in a meeting are you considering tariff on saudi arabian oil and then also — the president well i can always consider — look tariff have made a tremendous amount of money for our country i put them on china i put them on other place and other country tariff u and they take advantage of u and they have for many year look country have taken advantage of the united state for year they ’ ve ripped u off like nobody can even believe whether it be on — on manufacturing whether it be on exporting whether it be on almost anything including military where we provide virtually free military assistance to country that frankly take advantage of u don ’ t even like u okay so this ha been going on for year they tariff u they create artificial — you could say nonfinancial barrier which are worse than financial barrier you can ’ t sell your product you can ’ t take care of our farmer they won ’ t take our — and yet they ’ ll take u and sell into u and we won ’ t charge them anything for doing it look they ’ ve taken advantage of u for year tariff are a way of evening the score tariff are a way of just neutralizing they have tariff on u and we now can put tariff on them am i using it for oil it ’ s something we can no — am i doing it now no am i thinking about imposing it a of this moment no but if we ’ re not treated fairly it ’ s certainly a tool in the toolbox and what about with russia are you — would you consider maybe lifting sanction or giving some sanction relief if they — the president well it would be the same thing no it would be the same thing they are having a dispute — the two country — and it ’ s hurting the rest of the world because it ’ s really hurting the energy industry russia is being hurt unbelievably badly and saudi arabia is being hurt unbelievably badly because oil and gas is a primary — that ’ s where they get most of their income and this is a price like from the all right it ’ s a price from the they are being hurt very badly i think they ’ re going to settle their dispute pretty quickly why — on the oil why do you think you haven ’ t been more successful on getting them to raise the price the president go ahead please why — why do you think you haven ’ t been more successful in getting them to increase production in russia and saudi arabia if inaudible the president well they have increased production that ’ s what they ’ ve done they ’ ve increased it so much that there ’ s so — you meant the opposite the president i meant — yeah why do you think you haven ’ t been successful in inaudible increase production the president yeah look look just so — well they ’ re going to stop because the market ultimately the market is going to get them to stop but they both did the opposite they increased production to a level that water is right now more valuable than oil who would have ever thought right you have relationship with — the president you go to — you go to some of these kingdom water is far more valuable than oil there ’ s so much oil it ’ s a tribute in a way inaudible the president but what happened is there wa a lot to start off with and then you had the virus and it knocked the hell out of the market it — in term of demand so there ’ s no demand and there ’ s tremendous supply so i mean you saw number where it wa down to and down frankly below it wa even below it ’ s an incredible thing the market but ultimately the marketplace will take care of it but i think they ’ re going to work out their problem fairly quickly okay go ahead mr president — thank you mr president we ’ re already talking about phase four of a stimulus right but you and pelosi and mcconnell are already talking about different thing that should be in it now last time people were telling me that the fact that you wouldn ’ t talk to pelosi wa an impediment and it really slowed thing down are you — the president i ’ d talk — if it were important to talk to her i ’ d talk to her are you going to talk to her during the — the president if it were important for the american people i ’ d talk to her but other than that i can have other people talking to her look you ready infrastructure is a great thing for me i think infrastructure for this country — we have an old broken infrastructure fifty year ago we were the envy of the world and then we spent all this money so stupidly in the middle east we spent — it ’ s going to be very close to trillion in the middle east how stupid wa that decision but they spent it on that and other thing we ’ ve got to fix our infrastructure but pelosi is already downplaying — the president that mean road highway tunnel airport everything we got to fix our infra — but pelosi is already kind of downplaying — the president and the beauty is because of the fact that we are so strong a a country we ’ re borrowing at zero we never had a chance to borrow at zero even in this country we ’ d never had a chance to borrow at zero we ’ re going borrow — this is a great time so we can fix our infrastructure and we ’ ll have almost no interest cost this is the time to do it steve one more question the death total projection that you shared with u earlier this week are we still on the current trajectory for that or have social distancing — the president which trajec — which one i have many trajectory for many thing the — to to are we still on that trajectory or have we made any improvement or maybe not enough time ha passed the president say — say it say it steve what have we made enough improvement the president on what on what on social distancing have the model changed have the model changed the president i ’ d have to ask dr fauci and i ’ d have — have to ask deborah have the model changed dr birx so a lot of the projection you can see are based on — there ’ s many different way to look at this and a we discussed on sunday some of it is based on the current global experience we are about i think or time the size of italy a different factor in spain and we look at all of those — what their projection are where they are currently and where that is going and so a lot of the work is based on how this virus ha moved through other population that ’ s a very direct way to see how the virus is impacting a population there ’ s also terrific model and so every day and every night one of the model that actually look at the model related to mortality is the healthdataorg data and they update it every night and you can see where we are in that projection i think in the last run of that model they were at or something in the model now all of that can be changed by our behavior and so — and all of it can be changed in a different way if we don ’ t follow those behavior if another major metropolitan area end up having an epidemic like the new york metro area that could dramatically change not the model but the reality of the impact of this virus on american and where are the model on — the president and by the way the model show hundred of thousand of people are going to die you know what i want to do i want to come away under the model the professional did the model i wa never involved in a model but — at least this kind of a model but you know what hundred of thousand of people they say are going to die i want much le than that i want none but it ’ s too late for that but i want very few people relative to what the model are saying those are projection i hope they ’ re wrong i hope we ’ re going to be under those projection mr president two question on continuity of government for — the president how come you always have two why can ’ t you have one well they ’ re related the president every time “ i have three question i have two question can you give me one instead because we have a couple of other people go ahead okay i ’ ll go with my second one the governor of wisconsin is now talking about delaying the primary at least not having inperson voting so my question is — and i asked this a couple week ago i want to see if you ’ ve made any progress on this looking ahead to the fall are you taking step to ensure that the general election will happen even if this pandemic ha reemerged or hasn ’ t gone away and — the president the general election will happen on november and do you — are you — the president in wisconsin what happened is i through social medium — medium put out a very strong endorsement of a republican conservative judge who ’ s an excellent brilliant judge he ’ s a justice and i hear what happened is his poll number went through the roof and because of that i think they delayed the election you don ’ t think the governor is concerned about people going to inperson voting the president i don ’ t know why didn ’ t he do it before he wa doing right before the election but do you think every — the president excuse me why didn ’ t he do this two week ago all of a sudden — but isn ’ t it — because of the pandemic the president excuse me all of a sudden an election which is taking place very soon get delayed now i just endorsed him today and it wa a very strong endorsement his poll — he ’ s gone very high up and all of a sudden the governor come out — the democrat governor by the way — come out and say “ oh we ’ re going to move this election so i don ’ t know i ’ m sure — i hope you ’ re right i hope you ’ re right but — but do you think every state in this country should be prepared for mailin voting in case we ’ re in a situation — the president no because i think a lot of people cheat with mailin voting i think people should vote with id — voter id i think voter id is very important and the reason they don ’ t want voter id is because they intend to cheat when you get something when you buy something you look at your card and credit card and different card — you have your picture on many of them not all of them but on many of them you should have a picture on your — on your — for voting it should be called “ voter id they should have that and it shouldn ’ t be mailin — but how are you going to — the president excuse me it shouldn ’ t be mailin voting it should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself you don ’ t send it in the mail where people pick up — all sort of bad thing can happen by the time they signed that if they sign that — if they signed that by the time it get in and is tabulated no it shouldn ’ t be mailed in you should vote at the booth and you should have voter id because when you have voter id that ’ s the real deal thank you very much we ’ ll see you tomorrow en pm edt

quickly and then we ’ ll have a discussion afterwards you know our relief package includes provision to allow business to deduct their loss this year against tax they paid in previous year which get you a lot of liquidity and a lot of company need the liquidity right now and hopefully we ’ re going to be back in business very soon we ’ re going to be open very soon this country wasn ’ t built to

anything to say by the way leader mccarthy well first i want to thank you for doing this just by you reaching out to president putin and the crown prince thing have improved you ’ re looking around at a lot of job but what else you ’ re not seeing at this table a lot of these are small business that work with all these individual around here and your action today with signing the care act getting the smallbusiness loan out is going very strongly — the president yeah leader mccarthy — because it ’ s needed the president it ’ s doing well leader mccarthy but the american economy — the greatest strength is our — what energy provides u you provide u at a good price these are great job but more importantly it also give u energy independence it change the whole dynamic around the world and so i thank you for the leadership and what you ’ re doing the president thank you kevin and a you just said the bank of america in particular ha really — of the big bank — ha really stepped into it they have done a fantastic job today it ’ s over — leader mccarthy ten thousand in the first two hour the president yeah bank of america ha been unbelievable and i want to thank them i want to thank all of the community bank and the smaller bank that have been loaning a lot of money — paycheck it ’ s all about the paycheck and that — nobody would have believed it could have gone so well so it ’ s — it ’

stepped right up and they did it there were no big deal they weren ’ t making a big deal out of anything so that wa terrific and i think what we want to do — john cornyn please i know how you are so involved in this coming from the great state of texas would you like to say a couple of word john senator cornyn thank you mr president thank you for convening the meeting many of u have been talking together but we can ’ t get done what need to be done only you and the administration can and particularly getting the attention of the saudi and flooding the market really adding insult to injury in a time when on our economy wa suffering anyway because of the coronavirus and so this meeting could not be more timely i agree with what ’ s been said about the importance of affordable energy to our standard of living and really we ’ ve changed the — changed the world a a result of the production of domestic energy here and improved the quality of life for a lot of people the president thanks very much john really good job and john agrees — we were talking about it the other day — that you ’ ve all done well but you ’ ve also kept energy very affordable really very very affordable and very — a lot of it we never had any problem and we ’ re going to keep it that way do i see dan back there dan senator sullivan yes sir mr president laughter the president i wa looking — i thought that looked like dan senator sullivan i want to thank you for convening this meeting you know under the trump administration working with the congress the u ha become the world ’ s energy superpower again it ’ s unbelievable and these company have done it obviously it ’ s a very important issue in my state the great state of alaska but these are great job a john cornyn just said for all of our state but it ’ s really important for the national security of our country too and we have been — a number of senator have been reaching out having frank discussion with the saudi saying “ hey if you ’ re a longstanding ally of ours we ’ re not — right now you ’ re hurting a lot of our citizen you ’ re hurting a lot of the people we represent and shouldn ’ t take u for granted ” we have a great military that ’ s protected saudi arabia for decade and senator cramer and i have some legislation that could possibly change that if they don ’ t start cooperating so again we appreciate your leadership with the crown prince with the russian in calling this meeting but this is a great sector of the u economy that once we get through this and we will — of this pandemic this –this sector is going to take off again and your — your administration and you have had a lot to do with the strength of the u energy sector and we need to keep it strong the president thank you very much dan and kevin cramer north dakota people don ’ t realize how big a producer north dakota is right senator cramer well harold know laughter senator cornyn harold know senator cramer it sort of allows the others inaudible the president harold — harold know that ’ s for sure senator cramer mr president to echo everything and maybe add a little bit the people around your cabinet table right now are part of the renaissance of oil and gas in this country but since you became president we went from a renaissance to security to independence to dominance and that dominance and that security are — right now are in some danger just a quick example in north dakota since saudi arabia and russia announced their little price war we ’ ve had billion of cutback taken out of our state planned for this year the president yeah senator cramer i wa economic development director when the entire gross domestic product of north dakota wa billion so that ’ s significant that represents not just capex that represents lot of job lot of people in the value chain and i would just add one word to what dan talked about with regard to saudi arabia it is estimated by one report in that we spent a minimum of billion defending global oil supply we can use that money in national defense and other hotspot in the world if our friend are going to treat u this way so i appreciate your outreach this week i think we ’ re halfway there just with the success of your diplomacy this week thank you for this meeting the president well it ’ s gone up it ’ s gone up and we have to otherwise we do — we lose a lot of job too we ’ re talking about one of the big job producer anywhere kevin right would you have anything to say mr sommers mr president thank you i ’ m mike sommers i ’ m president and ceo of the american petroleum institute the folk around this table represent the american energy revolution and we want to thank you for everything that you ’ ve done to support that revolution and we want to make sure that revolution continues — the president right mr sommers — after this pandemic crisis is solved the president thank you mike mr sommers thank you sir the president thank you very good leader mccarthy i think senator cruz wa somewhere — the president i think he ’ s around here leader mccarthy right back there ted can ’ t be seen the president where — where is senator cruz participant he ’ s hiding behind the press laughter the president i can ’ t believe it he ’ s gone — he ’ s gone over to the evil side laughter that ’ s terrible cruz what are you doing there senator cruz mr president thank you for convening this meeting this is an important meeting and this is the time a you know of crisis all across the country — a public health crisis and an economic crisis a you ’ ve heard and a you know from everyone around this table the energy sector ha been a huge part of the economic success and boom that we ’ ve enjoyed over the last several year and the combination of the economic harm of the coronavirus crisis combined with the saudi and russian waging economic warfare on job in this country it ’ s been a perfect storm in the energy sector and i ’ ll tell you there are a lot of job — there are million of job in texas and across the country that are represented by the men and woman around this table and by energy producer and there are small producer throughout texas and throughout the country who are — who are on the verge of being driven out of business and so this — this meeting i think is important every one of the senator in this room ha had multiple conversation with the saudi leaning in hard on the saudi and your leadership and diplomacy with the crown prince had a big impact getting them to stop flooding the market and taking advantage of this crisis and i would underscore one other issue that a number of the folk around this table have raised and i ’ m very concerned about is ensuring that those in energy in this time of crisis have access to capital that — there are job that are hanging in the balance and if the energy producer in this country that have made america the number one producer of oil and gas in the world can ’ t access capital to get out of this crisis we ’ re going to see bankruptcy at a level this country hasn ’ t seen in decade and so this meeting and the continued leadership of your administration is hugely important thank you the president good thank you very much ted and while you ’ re up the concept and for instance — i think we should say it in front of the medium — but oil reserve storing oil we ’ re filling up the national reserve a you know we ’ re getting the oil at a great price but at these price — in fact kevin and i have been speaking about it john and i have been speaking about it — at these price you would think you ’ d want to fill up every cavity that we have in this country and there ’ s some area in louisiana and other area that could be filled up they hold a lot of oil but at these price — and it would be good and it would keep everybody working — but you would think you ’ d want to fill up those area what do you think of that ted senator cruz look i think that ’ s exactly right i think it make sense in term of easing the pressure that is threatening these job but it also make sense for the taxpayer the president yeah senator cruz that strategic petroleum reserve is there in time of crisis and usually the way the federal government work is we buy when it ’ s expensive and we sell when it ’ s cheap the president yeah no it ’ s — senator cruz we actually have an opportunity now to buy when it ’ s cheap i think it wa inexcusable that democratic leadership in the house and senate blocked that in this bill we passed last week and then i think congress need to go back and address it leader mccarthy it wa in the bill senator cruz yep leader mccarthy and then the speaker came in and that ’ s the one thing — when she held this bill up for the number of day — that she removed the president twentydollar oil think of it leader mccarthy yeah the president twenty dollar senator cruz well and there are too many democrat — the president it ’ s politics senator cruz — that want to see these — the president it ’ s all right senator cruz — job go away the president i think you should go back though kevin i think you should go back and see john if you guy can go back and do a separate bill and beyond that you know i think it ’ s million barrel right now to fill it up that ’ s not that much so it ’ s fairly in pretty good shape but we have other area that are bigger frankly that we can fill up too but at those price we should be — we should be pumping it out so maybe you guy can check on it and see what you can do about it i don ’ t think anyone can reject it nobody can reject it ted you ’ ll work on that senator cruz absolutely the president anybody else david you guy okay david you want to say something secretary bernhardt so just one thing mr president the department of the interior manages a large portion of land and part of the offshore and one of the thing we have done over the last day a you had the “ slow the spread ” we have really had our inspector out on the frontlines working to make sure that the production that ’ s taking place is occurring in a safe and a responsible manner and i thank everybody for their cooperation in that these job are so important to the american people and it ’ s important that we make sure that we dot our i ’ s and cross our t ’ s too the president he ’ s the biggest landlord in

happy to announce we went to market this week for million barrel notwithstanding the — the desire of the congress not to give u new money to pursue this idea we have found an alternative financing mechanism — the president good secretary brouillette — so that we can immediately find — the president i figured you would laughter i actually wasn ’ t worried about it laughter secretary brouillette — so that can we can find — the president what are you paying per barrel secretary brouillette i ’ m sorry sir the president what are you paying laugh he didn ’ t want to answer secretary brouillette

president thank you steve for jovita or steve any question please mr secretary chase bank sent a letter to it business client today saying that they don ’ t have the necessary guidance from the sba from the treasury department to be able to accept loan application starting tomorrow the need is clearly enormous but at least one major bank say they ’ re not fully empowered yet to be able to help their customer secretary mnuchin well a i spoke to all the ceo yesterday — i had a conference call with them — we got very good input from them on what they needed a i said people were working until o ’ clock i believe we just put up the federal register with the new guideline for lender i ’ ve been assured that the bank will be in the process starting tomorrow now again it ’ s going to take a little bit of time but we committed that this will be available tomorrow and i encourage all company go to sbacom sbagov go to treasurygov you can see the information you need immediately just to follow up with the smallbusiness owner a number of them are saying that they were on that conference call and that there ’ s a tremendous power struggle going on between the treasury and sba and that it ’ s over process and form is what they tell me that lender are actually opting out because they can ’ t make enough money to even service the loan so how are you going to make sure these smallbusiness owner get the capital they need to survive right now secretary mnuchin well first of all i can assure you — jovita is here jovita used to work for me a the treasurer there is no power struggle administrator carranza no secretary mnuchin jovita and our team a i said worked together until o ’ clock in the morning and started working at o ’ clock again we ’ ve made the form simpler and i can assure you at five point — i ’ ve told these banker they should take all their trader and put them in the branch there ’ ll never be another opportunity to earn five point on a government — fully governmentguaranteed loan and those check right into direct deposit the irs now saying it would take four to five month you ’ re saying two week can you give u a solid — secretary mnuchin well let me be — let me be clear i don ’ t know where you ’ re hearing these thing i told you this would be three week i ’ m not committing to two week we ’ re delivering on our commitment the irs which i oversee within two week the first money will be in people ’ s account just to follow up on that i think the question is not about the first check for folk who have direct deposit it sound like those will go out pretty quickly the question is then for folk who don ’ t have direct deposit secretary mnuchin sure and there wa a staff memo that wa released by the house way and mean committee today saying that that process could take up to five week sic that take you to midaugust is that how long it ’ s going to take secretary mnuchin that is not going to take five — or five month i ’ m sorry secretary mnuchin again let me just say when obama sent out these check it took month and month and month i am assuring the american public they need the money now what we ’ re going to do is — again if we have your information you ’ ll get it in two — in — within two week social security you ’ ll get it very quickly after that if we don ’ t have your information you ’ ll have a simple web portal you ’ ll upload it if we don ’ t have that we ’ ll send you check in the mail how many check can you process in a week though how many check can you — secretary mnuchin again we can process a lot of check but we don ’ t want to send check in this environment we don ’ t want people to get check we want to put money directly into their account thank you mr secretary this is for i guess both you and the administrator there have been some anecdotal report that business people are trying to get access to the online site to submit the application the website ha been crashing i ’ ve heard of webinars going offline because there ’ s just too many people on them so how are you guy going to be ready you know tomorrow to get these loan out secretary mnuchin we ’ ve brought in a lot of external resource at sba and u to make sure there ’ s additional capacity a i said we heard a lot of good feedback yesterday to simplify this process it ’ s going to be up and running now let me just be clear that doesn ’ t mean everybody is going to get their loan tomorrow but the system will be up and running we encourage people over the next week sign up you can go on right now you can go on the web see what information you need very simple process mr secretary on a separate subject have you been in touch with leader mcconnell and speaker pelosi about their difference right now about another stimulus package secretary mnuchin i spoke to — i ’ ve spoken to the leader i ’ ve spoken to the speaker i ’ ve spoken to the president constantly when the president is ready and think we should do the next stage we ’ re ready the president ha talked about the issue of infrastructure since the campaign i think you know that ’ s a big priority for him and again if we run out of money on the smallbusiness program we ’ ll be back right away to congress to get this increased doe the unemployment number today increase the urgency of doing a phase four secretary mnuchin well let me just say you know we ’ re going through something that we ’ ve never done before where the government ha shut down big part of the economy because of health reason our economy wa in great shape our company were in great shape there are three way that american are going to be protected for small business they ’ ll get paid by their business through this program the direct deposit there ’ s also enhanced unemployment so we realized unfortunately there are a lot of company that because they aren ’ t in business over a short period of time — again we ’ re working with the state on enhanced unemployment and a soon a the medical professional and the president give the all clear we ’ re going to have a ton of liquidity we have about trillion — this ha never been done between u and the fed — to put into the economy to support american worker and american business mr secretary in addition to the jobless number we saw today phase three wa signed before the social distancing guideline were extended for another month so what additional relief are you going to give to american a they stay out of work for all these extra week i mean what are you waiting for secretary mnuchin well we — in designing this program we thought that we had liquidity for about week and that ’ s what we ’ ve designed and again i think the president ’ s been very clear if we need to go back to congress to support the american economy and american worker we will be doing that secretary mnuchin house speaker nancy pelosi ha formed a select committee to oversee the distribution of recovery fund and she say she want to make sure that those fund are wisely and efficiently spent do you think that select committee is something that ’ s necessary secretary mnuchin i don ’ t i mean you know the — both party wanted u to have oversight wanted u to have transparency we have full transparency we have a oversight committee that the speaker get to pick someone the leader get to pick someone i believe there ’ s five people on it and again that committee will review the money that we ’ re spending and again we support full transparency taxpayer should understand how we ’ re going to support this economy and job mr secretary senator murkowski ha asked you to consider providing loan to energy company under the care act the phase three bill what are your thought on that would you consider providing those loan to energy company secretary mnuchin so thank you and let me clarify i have very limited ability to do direct loan out of the treasury i can do them for passenger airline cargo airline contractor and national security company outside of that we work with the federal reserve to create broadbased lending facility which we will do so so our expectation is the energy company like all our other company will be able to participate in broadbased facility whether it ’ s the corporate facility or whether it ’ s the “ main street ” facility but not direct lending out of the treasury a question for clarity about the direct payment to american for those folk who don ’ t have bank account who don ’ t have direct deposit information on file with the irs how long would they have to wait for their check secretary mnuchin well for people who don ’ t have direct deposit — again we ’ ll have an easy way they put it up we can on a rolling basis — i think you know within a couple of day when they give it to u we ’ ll send the money out we do realize there are people who are underbanked and again we ’ re working with all the digital company prepaid debit card we ’ re working with all of them to make sure we have a process that every american get their money quickly this money doe people no good if it show up in four month and we will deliver on that promise so “ quickly ” is a matter of week then perhaps not month secretary mnuchin “ quickly ” is a matter of week and not month that ’ s correct mr secretary would you consider a moratorium — secretary mnuchin in the back go ahead mr secretary one area where you can make direct loan is to the airline how much do you expect that the treasury department and the federal government will be involved in overseeing the operation of airline a it pertains to which route get cut back how much they operate what they do about their employee and the like secretary mnuchin so there are — there are very strict requirement that ’ s built into the bill again this wa a bipartisan requirement one anything we do with the airline they have to maintain substantially all of their employee so again any money that we provide them will go to pay their employee we ’ re going to be working with the secretary of transportation there are requirement to maintain certain route so again we have a very clear process we ’ ve hired three outside advisor who will be financial advisor and three law firm we ’ ll be releasing that information shortly and i want to thank them they ’ re all working for basically very very little money they couldn ’ t work for free so they ’ ve agreed to basically work for what they would sign up to work for charitable organization so again no big fee to banker we ’ ve got a great team of three lawyer and three financial advisor that will assist u mr secretary just to follow up on that will you give u a list of the name of those people who are advising you when you release the information secretary mnuchin of course we will we ’ ll give you the name a well a the contract so again — do you have any name right now other than blackrock secretary mnuchin so again i ’ m happy to announce we have — the pjt partner — okay — is going to do the passenger airline moelis company is going to do the cargo and contractor and perella weinberg will handle the national security and there ’ ll be three law firm which we ’ ll announce shortly that will be working in each one of those sector and again let me just be clear we need to get this done quickly the airline need money we ’ re going to work very closely with the department of transportation and get this done quickly we ’ ve actually already received contract from a lot of the people again there ’ s guidance up on the web full transparency we ’ ve asked for application mr secretary on the airline issue again you know speaker pelosi and others have said that the government taking stake in those airline should not be a condition for the federal government to provide payroll support specifically what ’ s your response to that secretary mnuchin i spoke to the speaker last night about that this wa something that wa highly negotiated between the republican and the democrat the president wa personally involved in this he wa on the phone with u many time mitch mcconnell mark meadow senator on both side there is a specific line in the bill that say that the secretary meaning me will determine proper compensation so this is not a bailout for the airline and i will be working — once we get our advice from our financial advisor we get the application from the airline i ’ ll be working very closely with the president and we ’ ll make sure that we strike the right balance not a bailout taxpayer get compensated but these airline — these are national security issue we want to keep our airline intact mr secretary just more broadly for — perhaps for the administrator if not for you a well some small business restaurant owner for example are finding that laying off their employee so that they can start collecting unemployment is better both for them a business owner and for their worker what incentive do they have right now to keep their employee on the payroll if no one is coming into their restaurant secretary mnuchin well the incentive that you have — and we want american business to be kept intact the incentive is these are loan that turn into grant so if you ’ re a business owner and you ’ re a restaurant you can hire your people back you get money for their medical you keep them on the medical plan you get money for your rent you get money for your electricity so you ’ re motivated we want you to have a business that you can reopen quickly when it ’ s appropriate so this doesn ’ t cost the business owner anything you know when people talk about — i can ’ t imagine any american worker who had a job ha offered to keep their job isn ’ t going to want to have it and let me just be clear — we ’ ve also talked about this unemployment issue you can only get unemployment if you don ’ t have a job so unemployment is intended for those people that are some of the midsize or larger business — and we ’ re very sympathetic to this — that these company can ’ t afford and for those people the enhanced unemployment will be a significant benefit but we want to make sure — percent of the american workforce is small business under people the president the vice president the administrator and i want to make sure this part of the economy is ready and intact when we ’ re ready to reopen a question for the administrator if i may is there a certain category of small business that you ’ re most concerned about restaurant hair salon thing like that administrator carranza that ’ s a great question we ’ re concerned about every small business there ’ s million small business that we ’ re really focused on and we ’ re working feverishly to make sure that we can provide the available fund to them a quickly a possible so it ’ s million small business and the other business are being dealt with with the ppp with the paycheck protection there wa also the disaster — what we call it the injury — or economic injury disaster loan and then there wa an advance associated with that particular program a well so to answer your question we ’ re concerned about all business and a the secretary indicated we ’ re looking at employee being ready not lost in this process we want business to stay intact because they represent half the — half the gdp so if we spend a trillion to support trillion or trillion i think that ’ s a significant investment and that ’ s what we ’ re focused on is there a certain segment that ’ s particularly vulnerable secretary mnuchin let me — i just want to — hang on i just want to make one comment for explanation because i want to make sure everybody out there understands this if you ’ re an independent contractor if you ’ re a sole proprietor you ’ re eligible for this a well now that program won ’ t be up and running until next week but again this is a very broad definition of small business so if you ’ re an independent plumber if you ’ re an independent contractor you ’ re covered under this program it ’ s slightly more complicated you have to come in to your bank and give them more information but starting next week that part of the program will be up and running also charity charity a well very important the vice president and president made sure that we covered small charity in this and doe that include church and religious nonprofit secretary mnuchin it doe although there are some technical issue but yes it doe include faith organization is that under the under the — that ’ s under the sba program secretary mnuchin this is under the ppp yes the new sba program they are covered the president okay thank you all very much secretary mnuchin okay thank you everybody the president thank you jovita thank you steve great job thank you okay so that begin right away and they start handing out check and a lot of people are going to have their business built back up quickly i hope and we ’ ll see it ’ s complicated big small business is actually big business so i thank them both and please — good we have some great gentleman let me see great gentleman that ’ s correct thank you very much today my administration is also issuing new guideline to protect elderly american who remain the most vulnerable by now nursing home should have suspended the entry of all medically unnecessary personnel today we ’ re further recommending that all nursing home facility assign the same staff to care for the same group of resident consistently to minimize any potential spread and we ’ re also urging facility to designate separate area for healthy and sick resident and this is a practice that we probably will be recommending into the future long after the enemy is gone — this particular enemy is gone we ’ re also making every effort to provide relief to our great veteran we take very good care of our veteran at my direction secretary wilkie will use any authority at his disposal to extend deadline for benefit and to postpone debt collection we ’ re now conducting well over coronavirus test per day it ’ s over a thou — a hundred thousand test a day –and these are accurate test and they ’ re moving rapidly — which is more than any other country in the world both in term of the raw number and also on a per caput basis the most the fda ha also authorized the first coronavirus antibody test developed by cellex a key step that will help identify people who have recovered and to understand their immune response and their immune system moment ago i directed secretary azar and acting secretary wolf to use any and all available authority under the defense production act to ensure that domestic manufacturer have the supply they need to produce ventilator for patient with severe case of covid you know what that is right become a very famous term covid — covid this action will help general electric hillrom medtronic resmed royal philip and vyaire medical overcome obstacle in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilator we have over being built right now or soon to be started we anticipate issuing more order under the defense production act in the very near future in addition to the one that i ’ ve just signed against for facemasks — we just signed an element of the act against and hopefully they ’ ll be able to do what they are supposed to do i just spoke to mary barra of general motor and she said they ’ re very soon going to be ready to start production of the ventilator they have a lot of ventilator that they ’ ve committed to build and they ’ ll be starting very very quickly fema continues to deliver resource to area most affected by the virus including new york on top of the bed we ’ re already providing to the javits center the department of defense is adding another icu bed governor cuomo ha asked that this facility go — and it ’ s a big beautiful facility — it be converted to a covid hospital and we hadn ’ t done that yet we hadn ’ t thought in term of doing that but their use is — their real demand is for that and we had meeting on it with the task force we had meeting with the military and i ’ ve decided to say “ yes i ’ m going to do that ” that i will be signing and agreeing to a “ yes ” answer so that — we will be doing that and also we will be staffing it so the federal government is doing a lot of thing that wasn ’ t anticipated that it do this is a — andor can easily be set up — hospital built in javits center and so we ’ re going to be converting that to a hospital and it ’ s going to be staffed by the military and by the federal government and based on the fact that i agreed to that we had two other facility that were likewise asking for it and that would be in louisiana and also in dallas and we ’ ll be doing those we spoke to the governor of louisiana spoke to the governor of texas and we ’ ve told them that we will be staffing those hospital again above and beyond but that ’ s okay we have to do that in addition the usn comfort is docked in new york to accept patient that is a noncovid to date fema ha delivered more than million mask respirator and it ’ s — think of that million four million don ’ t forget we ’ re a secondary source the state are doing it and we ’ re backing them up but we ’ ve gotten million respirator million surgical mask face shield million glove and ventilator just to the city and to the state of new york and some of them now are being sent i spoke with both governor cuomo and mayor de blasio a little while ago and some of them are being sent to the city all of america stand with the people of new york in this time of need it ’ s definitely a hotspot but we have other hotspot also and we ’ re taking them — taking care of them very very strongly very powerfully we have the finest people in the world in those location and i think the federal government ha not only acted early but acted quickly professionally there ’ s no people like this doctor nurse first responder and other healthcare provider who want to help new york at this critical time should visit website nycgovhelpnow nycgovhelpnow they need help now they need people to help them we have great facility and we ’ ve built some brandnew facility big one but we need help we need help for professional people so if you ’ re in an area that isn ’ t so affected and you ’ re a doctor a nurse a healthcare worker please get to that website and we would really appreciate your help new york city need it louisiana by the way need it michigan need it whatever you can do those are very strong hotspot they need help in recent week a the virus ha spread and economic hardship ha followed we have seen american unite with incredible selflessness and compassion i want to remind everyone here in our nation ’ s capital especially in congress that this is not the time for politics endless partisan investigation here we go again have already done extraordinary damage to our country in recent year you see what happens it ’ s witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt and in the end the people doing the witch hunt have been losing and they ’ ve been losing by a lot and it ’ s not any time for witch hunt it ’ s time to get this enemy defeated conducting these partisan investigation in the middle of a pandemic is a really big waste of vital resource time attention and we want to fight for american life not waste time and build up my poll number because that ’ s all they ’ re doing because everyone know it ’ s ridiculous so we want to focus on the people of this country even the people of the world — we ’ re going to be able to help them — because right now a an example we ’ re building so many ventilator — very very hard to build — but we ’ re building thousand thousand of them and a lot of them will be coming at a time when we won ’ t need them a badly because it take time very complex very expensive and we ’ ll be able to help outside of our country we think we ’ ll be able to help that ’ s something that you can not easily produce a citizen we ’ re linked together by the shared bond of national love loyalty and affection there ’ s no earthly force more powerful than the patriotic pride that stir in our heart and that is so true it ’ s incredible the job that everybody ha been doing everybody they don ’ t sleep they don ’ t go to bed sometimes they get nothing i said to somebody recently on the task force “ how many hour ’ sleep have you gotten over the last couple of day the answer wa “ none none in one massachusetts neighborhood citizen come out of their home each night at o ’ clock from their porch and they sing “ god bless america others have joined in spreading from house to house down one street up to the next until their little town with a spirit of patriotism and reminding all american that we ’ re all in this together we ’ ll fight together and we will win together we ’ re going to win this now what i ’ d like to do is — i ’ m going to step out we have a meeting on this subject and i ’ m going to step out just for a few moment i ’ ll be right back we ’ ll answer some question but you have some very hardworking people who have done an incredible job led by vice president mike penny head of the task force and then jared kushner is going to say a few word and admiral polowczyk peter navarro dr birx and myself i ’ ll be right back so i ’ ll see you in a little while i did take a test it just came out this is from the white house physician you may have it it just came out i just took it this morning and i took it it took me literally a minute to take it and it took me i guess it wa or minute i went to work i didn ’ t wait for it but he said it took minute or something to come up with a conclusion and it said “ the president tested negative for so that ’ s the second one i think i took it really out of curiosity to see how quickly it worked and fast it worked and it ’ s a lot easier i ’ ve done them both and the second one is much more pleasant jeff i can tell you that much more pleasant so i ’ ll be back in a little while and mike please take over thank you thank you all very much i ’ ll be right back the vice president thank you mr president the white house coronavirus task force met today but earlier in the day the president convened all the key element of our supply chain team in the oval office for an update on the progress that we have been making working literally around the clock to make sure that our healthcare worker the people on the frontlines have the personal protective equipment and also the ventilator to be able to meet this moment and today you ’ re going to hear from the people that are literally working — working each and every day to make that happen dr deborah birx is also with u she ’ ll reflect in a few moment on the progress that we ’ re making analyzing the data each and every day we ’ re looking county by county state by state consulting with governor and local health official at the present moment more than million test have been performed and a you all are aware some american have tested positive for the coronavirus with now the loss over american and our heart are with their family beyond that we have been focusing not just on ensuring the testing is occurring but that the supply are flowing a the president just announced he made a decision today to deploy thousand of mask directly to new york city ’ s public hospital and our team will speak about that in just a moment and also the president took the unprecedented step to direct the department of defense to use military healthcare personnel to operate all covid facility at the javits center in new york at the convention center in new orleans and at the convention center in dallas and we informed each of the governor of those state today that at their request we were making those military medical personnel available to operate in an allcovid facility but we would emphasize to people in that community who believe you ’ ve been impacted or have contracted the coronavirus contact your local healthcare provider we anticipate in the new york area that your local healthcare provider will make the decision whether you are transferred to the javits center and in all case simply look to the guidance of your local governor about how best to receive the care that every american — every american is entitled to have beyond that let me say that we have been working through fema ’ s acquisition process not only to deploy but to gather up personal protective equipment and in just a few moment you will hear from admiral john polowczyk about the extraordinary progress that we have made in deploying not just the strategic national stockpile but also in identifying on the commercial marketplace around america and around the world literally million of mask surgical gown glove protective equipment and at this point we ’ ve distributed some ventilator and you ’ ll hear today specifically about the state that have received those ventilator we ’ re just — this team ha truly acted in an inspiring way and literally is working with dozen and dozen of people at the fema stabilization task force to make sure that we are leaving no stone unturned to find the supply we need let me also say today you ’ re going to hear from jared kushner senior advisor to the president of the united state but someone that the white house coronavirus task force directed to work with fema on supply chain issue and in recent week he ’ s been leading a working group in conjunction with fema that literally ha identified million of medical supply around the nation and around the world and we ’ re grateful for his effort and his leadership finally you ’ ll hear from peter navarro who will explain the action the president took today using the defense production act but a you hear detail today about medical supply that have been distributed those that have been purchased those that we ’ re making available the ventilator distributed to hospital and those that are available let me just remind every american that you can make a difference in ensuring that every patient ha the treatment that they deserve every healthcare provider every doctor and nurse and nurse ’ s assistant ha the protective gear to provide the care that you would want your family to have by putting into practice the president ’ s “ day to slow the spread ” i mean we want you to take to heart the president ’ s coronavirus guideline for america first to protect your own health to protect the health of your family to protect the health of your community we know so many people are asymptomatic and people that literally don ’ t know they have the coronavirus but have the ability to infect others we want you to put these guideline into practice social distancing using a drivethrough at a restaurant washing your hand on a regular basis but a we focus today on supply make no mistake about it every american can make sure that our healthcare worker and more importantly american that are struggling with coronavirus have the equipment to support their treatment by putting these principle into practice because the fewer american that contract the coronavirus the fewer american will have to enter our healthcare system and that ’ ll continue to preserve the capacity in our healthcare economy so we thank the million of american who have responded in the first two day of “ day to slow the spread and i ’ m just absolutely confident that in the day ahead every american is going to do their part — for your health your family ’ s health the health of your community — and to ensure the strength and vitality of the greatest healthcare system in the world with that let me introduce jared kushner to speak about the work that he ’ s been doing working with fema on ensuring a strong supply chain to meet this moment jared mr kushner thank you mr vice president and thank you for your great leadership on the task force and thank you to dr birx and dr fauci a well it ’ s been an honor working with you these past few week when the vice president first asked me to help on the task force with different task i asked the president what he expected from the task force and how i can best serve him and the task force what the president asked is that all of the recommendation that we make be based on data he wanted u to be very rigorous to make sure that we were studying the data collecting data a lot of thing in this country were happening very quickly and we wanted to make sure that we were trying to keep updating our model and making sure that we were making informed decision and informed recommendation to him based on the data that we were able to collect and put together the president wanted to make sure that we had the people doing the best job and making sure that we had the right people focused on all the thing that needed to happen to make sure that we can deliver in these unusual time for the american people the president also instructed me to make sure that i break down every barrier needed to make sure that the team can succeed this is an effort where the government is doing thing that the government doesn ’ t normally do where we are stretching we ’ re acting very quickly and the president want to make sure that the white house is fully behind the different people running the different line of effort to make sure that we get everything done in a speed that the president demand the president also wanted u to make sure we think outside the box make sure we ’ re finding all the best thinker in the country making sure we ’ re getting all the best idea and that we ’ re doing everything possible to make sure that we can keep american safe and make sure we bring a quick end to this in the best way possible and balance all the different aspect that need to be thought of while we do this this truly is a historic challenge we have not seen something like this in a very very long time but i am very confident that by bringing innovative solution to these hard problem we will make progress today we were briefing the president earlier he asked me to come out and talk a little bit about what we ’ ve doing on the supply chain task force which admiral polowczyk ha been leading and what he ’ s been very impressed by is the way that we ’ ve been resourceful to find product all over the world all over the country and we are finding way to solve the different problem the president ha been very very hand on in this he ’ s really instructed u to leave no stone unturned just this morning — very early this morning — i got a call from the president he told me he wa hearing from friend of his in new york that the new york public hospital system wa running low on critical supply he instructed me this morning i called dr katz who run the system asked him which supply wa the most supply he wa nervous about he told me it wa the mask i asked what his daily burn wa and i basically got that number called up admiral polowczyk made sure we had the inventory we went to the president today and earlier today the president called mayor de blasio to inform him that we were going to send a month of supply to the new york public hospital system to make sure that the worker on the frontline can rest assured that they have the mask that they need to get through the next month we ’ ll be doing similar thing with all the different public hospital that are in the hotspot zone and making sure that we ’ re constantly in communication with the local community one thing i will say just based on data is that we ’ ve been getting a lot of data from different governor and from different mayor and from different city one thing i ’ ve seen fema do very very well over the last week or so is now we ’ re getting realtime data from a lot of city people who have request for different product and supply a lot of them are doing it based on projection which are not the realistic projection the projection change every day a we see the case a we see the impact of the “ stop the spread ” effort that this task force recommended and the president ha been pushing forward so i do think that we ’ ll see that hopefully there ’ ll be impact of that and the task force ha been working very hard through the fema group with admiral polowczyk to make sure that we ’ re getting the supply to people before they run out and making sure that we ’ re doing it in a proper way i ’ d like to just introduce admiral polowczyk who before coming to this — i guess still is — he ’ s the vice director for logistics for the joint staff i got a call from one of the senator saying “ well why don ’ t you put a great military person in charge of the logistics and the supply chain and the defense production act and i said “ well the president already did that this is the best man that we have in the country for supply and logistics he joined the task force day ago over at fema and he ’ s built a team — really at the direction of the vice president — that includes people from fema omb the fda hhs the white house and from everywhere else and what they ’ ve don over the last day ha been really extraordinary we ’ ve done thing that the government ha never done before quicker than they ’ ve ever done it before and what we ’ re seeing now is we found a lot of supply in the country we ’ ve been distributing them where we anticipate there will be need and also trying to make sure that we ’ re hitting place where there are need so i can tell you the people on the — in the task force they ’ re working day and night you ’ ve got a lot of people in the government we recognize the challenge that america face right now we know what a lot of the people on the frontlines are facing the fear that they have that they won ’ t have the supply they need and our goal is to work a hard a we can to make sure that we don ’ t let them down so i just want to thank everybody and with that i want to introduce admiral polowczyk who ’ s doing an amazing job rear admiral polowczyk thank you mr kushner mr vice president so today i ’ m going to cover a couple item — a couple of — five thing the first thing i ’ m going to talk about is resource pushed out from the federal government and then i ’ m going to talk about this air bridge which you may have heard about i ’ m going to talk about data a you said we ’ re — mr kushner is absolutely right we ’ re trying to be data driven and with that i ’ m going to talk a little bit about how we ’ re trying to expand the industrial base here to meet this challenge so the first thing i want to talk about is surgical mask so we ’ ve all — we ’ ve quickly stated number here so these — i ’ m about to go through several different slide to give you just scale and magnitude of federal resource that have been applied at the problem so million surgical mask pushed out to state government for mask million mask and so if i wa — if i wa in a local hospital that wa running short i would — i would look upward because the federal government ha pushed out resource so for protective glove million million pair of protective glove for face shield million face shield for ventilator we have pushed to the state more than ventilator and i think a i wa coming over here that number ha changed slightly i think it ’ s now given to these state — to the predominantly of these state so we wanted you to have some number now a we ’ ve indicated we have ventilator in the national stockpile we pushed ventilator out we ’ re holding ventilator to put to the point of need but we ’ re also buying ventilator asking the industrial base who produce approximately — prior to covid approximately ventilator a year we are going to over the next several month by the end of june work to acquire and so one of the — one of the tool that we ’ re going to — i can anticipate needing — we ’ ve already executed — is all of those vendor that we ’ re buying them from will need — potentially will need help in their supply chain with their supplier we might rate order we might help them get ahead of others in that endeavor so i think mr navarro is going to talk a little bit more on that later so let me talk about the air bridge so it normally take approximately day to get from overseas the product — load it get it to the united state and distribute it that ’ s about day so to prime the pump so to speak we have lined on an air bridge to get product here faster working with our major supplier a they have — a they work to fill order to get more to healthcare worker now we are working to align transportation to product now one of the thing we ’ re also doing is the team that work for me are scouring the globe and finding pocket of personal protective equipment that might not otherwise be in the u hospital supply chain that is also going on these flight six completed and a number scheduled twentyeight flight scheduled here in the near future we ’ re — we are working towards — some day we ’ ll have one flight some day there might be two flight multiple flight over the next coming day these or — a far a i can see out to a couple of week then again matching product to flight to create volume in the supply chain here faster than the day i ’ m just going to leave that up a i talk about a few other item so let ’ s talk about new york city and the public health hospital i believe they ’ re called new york city health and hospital the president directed — a i speak there are pallet being formed truck being loaded i gave an address in new york city here an hour or two ago and one of our distributor is making that happen and that delivery will happen tomorrow on the data front this is almost unprecedented this is a commercial supply chain with six to seven major distributor of health equipment we brought them all in and we said we need to make informed decision and we are going to help make informed allocation decision so within a matter of day feeding from their business system — their enterprise resourcelike system — i brought onboard a tool — a supply chain tower — that the dod wa using to manage a supply chain for a very complex weapon system their data go into a data lake we have a tool to be able to use their data and see it i can tell what product is coming in what their order are what they ’ re filling what they ’ re not filling and see the volume in the supply chain and understand what they ’ re doing down to the county level we ’ re working to get it potentially down to the hospital level so this respirator we took a look in there in the supply chain and we said we can ’ t — we have the volume to go do that i called the distributor and they ’ re making — they ’ re making that happen we anticipate a the hotspot around the country — we anticipate these vendor at our direction helping them allocate product to the right place at the right time so if i can talk finally about expanding the industrial base so the vice president wa at walmart the other day who told him “ i want to get in this game how do i do that so i got the call we provided them specification and now walmart is going to have — use their supplier to cut fabric make gown sew product but that ’ s not always the case we have lot of folk that want to help i believe you will see in the coming day the use of the defense production act in creative way to help people that are not doing this today to do it we have essentially lead — well the number yesterday wa — i believe it probably grew today — that we are working with to find how each one of those might need help to get in the game that ’ s not in the game to increase the throughput through the healthcare market again the president gave me one task get more to our healthcare worker now and i took that to heart because i have — not that i don ’ t need that from the president that direction to move out — but i have family in new york my sister is a nurse practitioner in a westchester hospital and my niece is a nurse on a long island hospital and i have other healthcare professional in the family so i have skin in this game the president asked me to get more to the healthcare worker i ’ m going to get more to healthcare worker i ’ d like to hand it over to mr navarro the vice president inaudible the going out tomorrow — rear admiral polowczyk the is going out a we speak the vice president you might want to be very specific about that rear admiral polowczyk it ’ ll be — it ’ ll be delivered tomorrow can i ask a question the vice president let me — let me be clear on that if i can what jared announced what the admiral just unpacked is that pallet are being loaded right now to send mask — rear admiral polowczyk respirator the vice president — to new york city to the public health hospital rear admiral polowcyzk to the public health warehouse in new york city the vice president to all the healthcare worker help is on the way based on the tool and the data you have available to you where is the logjam where ha it been how have you identified that rear admiral polowcyzk i think — because a you say all this — when we have million more ppes going out the door a you well know the frontline medical worker are not getting it rear admiral polowcyzk so i would answer you — i would answer you this way we put up a lot of number i said that if you ’ re not a — you ’ re in a hospital and you ’ re not seeing ppe i would look up to the state level first but we aren ’ t — we ’ ve hearing from governor sir saying they can ’ t get the medical equipment that they need and the reason for that is because according to governor and also by the fact that we haven ’ t seen any number up there about what is going to the private sector can you tell u what percentage of the supply on these large cargo plane are going to private company versus fema versus the state is it percent rear admiral polowcyzk so fema is — so this product that we ’ re moving is primarily commercial product that would enter the commercial system and be distributed through financial business transaction between hospital and these distributor so just to clarify that that explains why state say they ’ re bidding like they ’ re on ebay because the supply are going to the private sector and then they have to go there to get the supply rear admiral polowcyzk that ’ s normally how thing –that ’ s normally how thing work right so i ’ m not here to disrupt a supply chain and say — look these six distributor — six seven — they have six to seven hundred warehouse they have truck to go to the hospital door every day we ’ re bringing product in they ’ re filling order for hospital nursing home like normal i ’ m putting volume into that system i would say that we have the data now at last — so we put together this data element over the last you know what thirteen day get the people in look at the problem build this i am now seeing truth about what ’ s in the supply chain and i would say that there ’ s been some abnormal behavior okay yes thank you admiral house oversight committee democrat say that fema official told them that the ventilator that the government ha ordered won ’ t be ready until june which is well after the expected peak will the defense production act memo signed today do anything to speed that up rear admiral polowczyk yes it will mr navarro will talk about that we ’ re on line to receive several thousand ventilator in the month of april and several thousand more ventilator in the month of may ramping up to a big number in june again going from you know an industry that produce about annum — annum to a — to a very big number admiral are you confident that this system mean the state with the greatest need are getting the supply rear admiral polowczyk yeah so — because a lot of governor are saying that they can ’ t get what they need and different state have more pressing urgency obviously depending on the caseload rear admiral polowczyk so we marry up — we ’ re marrying up where cdc — where the demand for covid is to what ’ s in the commercial system we ’ re providing that to these — to the commercial system and we are making allocation to those of most pressing need thirteen day — we now have the data we now can make informed decision and so all of the “ i need i need i need ” i now know the volume that ha been happening and need to be happening so admiral with that — and mr president i ’ d love for you to weigh on — the president sure — weigh in on this a well you talk about — well you alluded to the fact there is possibly some shady business going on that the product is here in the united state and — rear admiral polowczyk and coming here yes and it is coming here it ’ s coming from china it ’ s in warehouse it ’ s being made here in the united state it ’ s in warehouse but it ’ s going to the highest bidder so what can be done to keep those product here in the united state not go overseas where company are making a lot of money and — rear admiral polowczyk yeah i ’ m going to let mr navarro talk about that — and get it distributed to the most critical place here in the u the president yeah sure peter go ahead i would love to hear — how is that being done because doctor — i ’ ve talked to surgeon — mr navrrro that ’ s great great — great question — on a regular basis mr navrrro let me — let me give you the — the bigger view of the dpa and we ’ ll directly address that what we have essentially is a nation at war we have a wartime president standing behind me the defense production act is one of the most powerful weapon this administration can use to fight the invisible enemy of the virus when i spoke with you last week i explained the three point of the compass dpa can be used to hit the first one is mobilization of the industrial base this can involve thing like repurposing from say a distiller like pernod ricard — from liquor to hand sanitizer it can also involve expansion of production which is having honeywell — which make mask — opened a new factory in smithfield rhode island with respect to the second point in the compass — allocation of resource — we have two issue there if you look at the manufacturer itself what you want to make sure is that the supply chain which can go seventiers deep ha enough component in that supply chain so we can actually make what we need and then once it ’ s made you also want to make sure that it go to the right — right people and then the third point of the compass which — which address what you ’ re talking about is basically — “ bust ‘ em ” i call it — hoarding of critical or threatened material so let me walk through what — what the president did today in term of a strong action and what we ’ ve done with the dpa across those three point the first order that president trump signed wa vigorous swift it wa the gm order which directed gm to make ventilator in kokomo indiana in trump time — which is to say “ a fast a possible ” a the president mentioned he ’ d spoke to mary barra today the ceo of gm that is moving forward at the same time a the ford project is moving forward in rawsonville michigan and i ’ ve issued a challenge to those two company à la “ ford v ferrari ” — this is ford versus gm let ’ s see who get those ventilator out first now the second point of the compass which these two order address today is this allocation of resource issue the ventilator company themselves expressed concern that in this rush to build ventilator there would be pressure on that supply chain so what they requested that we do and the president do is to use the dpa to give this gentleman here — who ’ s one of the strongest gentleman in the world in term of applying thing — is to give him the ability to prioritize that supply chain for those ventilator manufacturer and he will do thing like give them what ’ s called a “ do rating ” in the defense procurement which will allow them to get what they need now the second order which the president signed today ha to do with the other part of the equation which is once they make the stuff okay doe it go to the right folk and this is a order and to be frank over the last several day we ’ ve had some issue making sure that all of the production that doe around the world — enough of it is coming back here to the right place so what ’ s going to happen with the signing of that order in trump time is we ’ re going to resolve that issue with probably by tomorrow at close of business because we can ’ t afford to lose day or hour or even minute in this crisis now the third part of the compass — this third point there — this get to the hoarding issue the president stood up here with — he ’ s the commanderinchief but we have a sheriff in town too attorney general barr and he stood up here with attorney general barr and bill barr said “ i ’ m going to go out and bust them and guess what three day ago doj went into a warehouse in jersey grabbed ppe and the beauty of that — the beauty of that it wasn ’ t only seized but within hour it wa turned around and given to healthcare professional in new york and new jersey that ’ s a beautiful thing that ’ s a beautiful case of using the dpa now what ’ s going to happen tomorrow is the president is going to sign another order which is in the work this is interesting there is a black market springing up which you have described where we ’ re having people bid against each other broker come in they ’ re bidding and bidding on all this different ppe it ’ s driving the price up and guess what you know where it ’ s going the domestic source here are being exported when president trump heard about that he said “ that ’ s not going to happen anymore under my watch so tomorrow we ’ re bringing that order and what it ’ s going to do is it ’ s going to empower custom and border protection with the help of people like the post office and express mail consigner like ups to basically deal with that issue so we are going to crack down unmercifully and i would say to the hoarder out there and the broker that are trying to make money off of the misery of people in this country around the world that ’ s got to stop and if you ’ ve got inventory what you need to do is pick up a phone and not call somebody out in — around the world you call fema and say “ we got some stuff we ’ ll give it to you at a fair price and be done with that because that stuff ha absolutely got to stop inaudible mr navarro so that ’ s — that ’ s — hang on hang on so that ’ s — that ’ s what we ’ re going to be looking for and when we hear case like this we ’ re going to aggressively issue order after order to crack down on it now before — this is not my role to take a bunch of question but let me tell you one other thing before i leave the podium it ’ s a story which i ’ d love to share with you today because this again illustrates the key principle of this president and this vice president which is to wed the full force of the federal government with the full power of private enterprise and just two day ago we at the white house got an urgent so from the chief of police of the new york police department and they are in a situation now because of the strain on their resource where personnel such a their homicide detective were having to go on into house and deal with covid issue without protective gear now the beauty of this president is because of his leadership we were able to solve that problem in two phone call two phone call the first one went to phebe novakovic at the general dynamic “ phebe can you call tom kennedy at raytheon i need you guy to basically scoop up all the tyvek suit you can and find any glove you can ” this president under his leadership and the voluntary effort and the pride and patriotism you talked about it earlier that — we had tyvek suit delivered to the new york pd within hour that ’ s — that ’ s a new record in trump time at the same time a second phone call wa made the tara engel at pernod ricard and laura lane at ups they were on the same phone call and i said “ tara laura we got this issue they need hand sanitizer literally within two hour we had drum gallon of hand sanitizer on a ups truck heading up to the nypd and it probably arrived today with a promise from pernod that they will continue to supply the nypd throughout the course of this crisis so this is a beautiful thing that america is rallying to we are becoming a stronger more united nation and i couldn ’ t be more proud of this president this administration these guy up here who are doing a heck of a job organizing the supply chain and my promise to you is that the president is going to use that dpa to make sure that the american people particularly our healthcare professional get the ppe the medicine everything we need so let me — let me stop there i don ’ t think it ’ s my place here to field a bunch of question the president no you ’ re doing a good job thank you mr navarro thank you mr navarro what ’ s the status of the “ buy american ” executive order the president go ahead go ahead answer — mr navarro sure the president you go ahead mr navarro okay — the president come here come here come mr navarro one of the — one of the thing that this crisis ha taught u sir is that we are dangerously overdependent on a global supply chain for our medicine like penicillin our medical supply like mask and our medical equipment like ventilator we have — right now a we speak over country have already imposed some form of export restriction in their country against the rest of the world and what we ’ ve — what we ’ re learning from that is that no matter how many treaty you have no matter how many alliance no matter how many phone call when push come to shove you run the risk a a nation of not having what you need and if there ’ s any vindication of the president ’ s “ buy american secure border and a strong manufacturing base ” philosophy strategy and belief it is this crisis — because it underscore everything that we see there so the “ buy american ” order which — which is going through process would do a couple thing it would simply say — not during this crisis because we don ’ t want to disrupt anything i want to be really clear about that but going forward after this is over the va dod hhs and this government buy american for essential medicine our medical countermeasure and the medical supply and equipment we need at the same time it will deregulate so we can get the fda and epa to facilitate domestic manufacturing and then innovate because the key here — the key here is having advanced manufacturing on u soil that can leapfrog other country so we don ’ t have to worry about competing against cheap sweatshop labor lax environmental regulation different tax regime and the massive subsidy of foreign government who are actually directly attacking our industrial base so be patient with that sir it ’ s — the other priority we have right now are to dpa and what the task force is doing but if we learn anything from this crisis it should be never again never again should we have to depend on the rest of the world for our essential medicine and countermeasure the president and by the way we ’ ve cut them out also to be honest we ’ ve stopped order going from certain place and in a couple of place — like we had a big order going to italy on important outfit and some ventilator and it wa going to italy they made the order a long time ago and i said “ you got to let it go they had an order and i could have cut it under the act i could have cut it i said “ nope you can ’ t do that you got to let it go you know they have big problem we had an order going to spain and i said “ let it go i could have stopped it i said “ let it go we ’ re going to be fine i said “ let it go so it work that way also one other thing a to your question oftentimes — and we ’ ve told this to the governor — mike we ’ ve been very strong on this — have — if you think there ’ s bidding between federal government and state let u know and we ’ ll drop out immediately or you drop out and we lower the price but state are bidding against each other the president no no if we ’ re bidding against each other i said find out who it is and usually they know everyone know and we ’ re notified and we get notified and we ’ ll either drop out or they ’ ll drop out but we have another problem there are country out there beyond the state there are country that have this problem and they ’ re ordering too it ’ s really a mess now in a little while the hardest thing to get are the ventilator because they ’ re — you know it take a while to build them and we have a lot we have thousand of them being built right now in a little while they ’ ll be worth about five dollar but right now they ’ re very valuable and we ’ re going to have a lot of them being shipped and in fact that ’ s why general motor called up before — mary that ’ s why others called up two day ago they called up that they ’ re all in production and they ’ ll start — they ’ re starting to arrive in a week and a half but there ’ ll be a time when we ’ re going to build stockpile by the way the state should have been building their stockpile we have almost in our stockpile and we ’ ve been building it and we ’ ve been supplying it but the state should be building we ’ re a backup we ’ re not an ordering clerk we ’ re a backup and we ’ ve done an unbelievable job like for instance who ever heard of a governor calling up “ sir can you build u a hospital of room and we built it “ can you build u four medical center we built it “ can you deliver a ship — a hospital ship — with room and we did it and we did it in los angeles too we ’ ve been an unbelievable — we ’ ve done an unbelievable job — these people and so — and thousand of people behind them but we ’ re a backup ideally those hospital would have had all this equipment ideally those state should have had all this equipment and i think they will the next time you know you heard the case where thousand of ventilator could have been had at a very inexpensive price three year ago and a certain state decided not to exercise that right because they wanted to build a road or they wanted to build something else because it ’ s big money you ’ re talking about — i think it wa a billion dollar but you ’ re talking about a lot of money for something that may never happen because normally on a ventilator — other than a pandemic or an epidemic — you wouldn ’ t — you wouldn ’ t need anything like this hospital have three ventilator — big hospital — and they get by with it and now they want thousand i mean they want thousand of ventilator you call up a governor and he ’ ll say “ sir could you send u ventilator nobody ha ever heard of a thing like this so they ’ ve done some job let me just tell you when secretary mnuchin spoke they want you to call not “ com ” but sbagov — okay — for the application and for information okay so it ’ s sba — small business — sbagov okay if you don ’ t mind yeah let ’ s go please thank you sir thank you mr president i want to follow up from a question yesterday regarding i think your administration ’ s denial of the expansion of obamacare special enrollment period in the wake of this pandemic in your own word — vp penny gave a fiveminute nonanswer — but people facing this pandemic — illness and even worse — most expert say that having healthcare is critical to our nation ’ s health and financial wellbeing the president right can you assure american tonight that you will reopen obamacare marketplace so that they can be covered in this time of combined health — the president well we ’ re — we ’ re doing better than that — and financial crisis the president yeah no i understand the question and we ’ re doing better than that we ’ re going to try and get a cash payment to the people and we ’ re working out the mechanic of that with legislature so we ’ re going to try and get them a cash payment because just opening it up doesn ’ t help a much so we ’ re going to work it out so we ’ re going to try and get for that certain group of people — it ’ s a certain group of people — a cash payment go ahead i really want to ask you about mask but i also just wanted to follow up on a couple of hanging thread there on just the question earlier about the bidding what happens though when state are bidding against each other on those market the president well they have that and they have to work that out what they should do is they should have — long before this pandemic arrived they should have been on the open market just buying there wa no competition you could have made a great price the state have to stock up it ’ s like one of those thing they waited they didn ’ t want to spend the money because they thought this would never happen and their shelf in some case were bare and by the way in some case they weren ’ t they were beautifully serviced they did a good job but in some case their shelf were bare so the best thing they can do is when time become normalized — and they will hopefully soon — and actually you ’ re going to have a lot of excess material because so much is being done right now in term of protective gear protective outfit a lot is being done it ’ s going to be — within six month it ’ s going to be sold for the right price they got to stack up for the next time but we are doing that and the admiral ha done a fantastic job senator schumer wrote a letter today and he say “ you should put a military man in charge i said “ well chuck if you knew a little bit more we have one of the most highly respected people in the military the admiral this is what he doe too very professionally and he ’ s in charge but chuck didn ’ t know that okay jeff please mr president you tweeted this morning about your call with saudi arabia ’ s mb the president yeah we ’ ve had some people say that the figure that you cited — between million and million barrel per day — is not what they ’ re agreeing to can you be more specific about what exactly they told u the president i don ’ t know what they ’ re agreeing to i think they might agree to more than that look russia — russia — did he tell you that sir the president yeah he did say that actually russia talked about million barrel russia and saudi arabia are fighting over this and a everybody know it ’ s you know really killing an industry hurting russia badly hurting saudi arabia badly i said “ this is an easy one it should be an easy one and it may be and it may be more than that i wa actually told it may be a i told somebody before it may be and it may be more than that maybe it ’ s maybe it go up to could be a high a and you know there ’ s a tremendous oversupply right now that industry wa — it wa oversupplied before the virus and when the virus came along they lost percent of the world and there ’ s an unbelievable — you can ’ t get a ship now every ship is loaded to the gill sitting out someplace in the ocean they ’ re storage tank they ’ re not even ship they ’ re storage tank so it would be great for russia it would be great for saudi arabia i hope they make that deal but that ’ s what they told me they said — inaudible million be — the president — they said it ’ s — — enough to address the oversupply issue the president well i think it will be hopefully soon i think hopefully they ’ ll announce something soon now can a deal be broken can something happen where it doesn ’ t happen i guess in which case there ’ s another alternative but i ’ d rather not see that other alternative i hope they can make a deal what do you mean when you say the “ alternative ” the president they both want — i think they both want to make a deal and they ’ re both smart they love their country they want to make a deal it ’ s good but it ’ s also good for the world if they do because you save an industry mr president — the president yeah please go ahead go ahead in the back please what do you by “ cash payment ” the president i ’ m going to let mike because we went over this very specifically and i ’ ll let you talk about it mike because you responded last time the vice president right thank you mr president a i said yesterday the president ha put a priority on ensuring that no american ha to worry about the cost of coronavirus testing and we ’ ve been working every day to make sure that american don ’ t have to worry about the cost of treatment and at this point the white house coronavirus task force is working on a proposal for the president to use some of the billion that we ’ re making available to hospital to compensate the hospital directly for any coronavirus treatment that they provide to uninsured american we ’ re working out the detail of that the president will make a final decision tomorrow we expect an announcement but the president ha made it very clear we don ’ t want american to worry about the cost of getting a test or the cost of getting treatment and we ’ ve expanded coverage through medicaid we ’ ve expanded coverage through medicare health insurance company around the country including blue cross just today announced that all of their member will be waiving all copayments on coronavirus treatment but for those some million uninsured american the president ha directed the coronavirus task force to find a way to make sure that they know we will find a way to pay for your coronavirus treatment and the president will be addressing that and announcing that tomorrow mr president — the president go ahead — a point of clarification and then a followup question yesterday you said that you spoke to florida governor ron desantis before he issued his stayathome order did you advise him to issue that order the president no but i talked to him about it and he want to do what ’ s right for the people of florida he ’ s been a great governor you could see that just by his popularity which is extraordinary we ’ re proud of him he ’ s done a fantastic job and he made the decision but we spoke before he made the decision yes and he had also said that he is considering putting people who are suspected of having coronavirus or who have tested for positive for it in isolation center and that he would potentially use — the president that i haven ’ t heard no that i haven ’ t heard so he hasn ’ t consulted with you the president i haven ’ t heard that yes please thank you mr president ebony bowden from the new york post a few hour ago mayor de blasio the mayor of new york said that new yorkers leaving their home should wear mask they should also wear mask when they ’ re with other people are you considering that kind of recommendation on a federal level and if you are how would you prevent a rush on mask the president well i think they ’ re going to be coming out with regulation on that and if people want to abide by them frankly i don ’ t think you — i don ’ t think there ’ ll be mandatory because some people don ’ t want to do that but if people wanted — a an example on the mask if people wanted to wear them they can if people wanted to use scarf which they have — many people have them — they can in many case the scarf is better it ’ s thicker i mean you can — if you — depending on the material it ’ s thicker but they can do that if they want now a recommendation is coming out we ’ ll see what that recommendation is but — is that a cdc recommendation sir the president but i will say this they can pretty much decide for themselves right now would that be nationwide and can i also just ask– the president nationwide nationwide — the president yeah — not just for hotspot and then i think this is best for dr birx but we ’ ve heard some differing guidance here the who and even the surgeon general have talked about various study that show that mask in addition to maybe not even being helpful to protecting people may actually increase the rate of illness because people touch the mask then they touch themselves the president sure can you talk a little bit about just the evolution of — the president all right maybe i will ask — — your thinking on this the president — dr birx and you might mention that other point also yeah thanks dr birx no no thank you so i hope you got from the conference today that we ’ re triangulating data that we know from the case number the testing number the supplychain number to create an integrated picture so that we can really support hospital in their need and i think that level of granularity is really critical secondly i just want to make the point that we really applaud the governor that are looking at a wholeofstate or a wholeofmetro approach and what do i mean by that the united state going into this had about ventilator across the united state and another to anesthesia machine that ’ s about five time what most of the european country have but it ’ s a matter of distribution to need and i really applaud the governor that are bringing together their public hospital with their more private hospital and their visibility across their state because what we tried to talk about yesterday is every state every county is different and that ’ s why we ’ re looking at it at that level of granularity and a we move through this epidemic the need need to be very tailored to those county and frankly those hospital i mean there ’ s a reason why the president and mr kushner have been very much involved in finding out what the public hospital need why is that because the public hospital sometimes have the weakest supply chain because they ’ re often sometimes not a attractive to private sector distributor or they may be too busy caring for the need of patient to be really on top of their order form and their supply chain so really listening to the community that ’ s at the front of this fight and getting feedback from those specific community no matter where they are and listening to the frontline healthcare worker because it ’ s their reality that is important to all of u whether you ’ re the mayor or the governor or the federal government and if they ’ re saying they need something we have to work together to supply that and so that ’ s what you ’ re seeing with this triangulation every county will move through this differently and that allows u to move around these vital issue that protect the frontline healthcare worker and protect the patient through the ventilator to make sure that the supply chain is aligned with the need a it happens now you have to have very good data in order to be willing to work in that level of granularity and that ’ s what we ’ ve been working on to really develop that level of granularity to ensure that so i just wanted to say one other thing about testing just to give you the bottomline data of what we ’ re seeing we appreciate the group who are reporting not everyone is reporting yet and this is part of u trying to understand at a very granular level we do have two state that do have percent positive and that ’ s new york and new jersey so that confirms very clearly that that ’ s a very clear and important hot zone louisiana though ha percent of their test are positive michigan connecticut indiana georgia illinois — so that should tell you where the next hotspot are coming — are at percent test positive and then colorado dc rhode island and massachusetts are at percent there ’ s a significant number of state still under percent everyone that i didn ’ t discus california and washington remain steady at an percent rate so what we ’ re seeing finally is testing improving — more testing being done still a high level of negative — in state without hotspot allowing them to do more of the surveillance and containment and then prioritizing this new rapid test kit to those area that may not have the same amount of access — to the indian health service and to the public health institution and the public health and state lab so that they can use that and start forward leaning into surveillance now we know there are people waiting for test and they ’ re waiting for test because when these area became very — when they got onto the logarithmic curve we prioritized people whose decision — where the test decision would make it critical for their care and so we prioritized hospital and we prioritized nurse and doctor and frontline worker the president good dr birx so that mean if you went through a drivethrough or you went through your doctor you could have that delay so the mask so what i tried to give you is how we ’ re using data in a very granular way and so there are — there is experiential data when you look at community that have oftentimes utilized mask — in general for personal protection — from when they particularly are themselves sick and have used their mask in public and we ’ ve looked at the rate of this in those population and then we ’ re looking at the scientific evidence to bring those two piece together let me just say one thing though the most important thing is the social distancing and washing your hand and we don ’ t want people to get an artificial sense of protection because they ’ re behind a mask because if they ’ re touching thing — remember your eye are not in the mask so if you ’ re touching thing and then touching your eye you ’ re exposing yourself in the same way so we don ’ t want people to feel like “ oh i ’ m wearing a mask i ’ m protected and i ’ m protecting others you may be protecting others but don ’ t get a false sense of security that that mask is protecting you exclusively from getting infected because there are other way that you can get infected because of the number of asymptomatic and mild case that are out there and so this worry u and that ’ s why the debate is continuing about the mask because we don ’ t want — when we ’ re trying to send a signal that every single person in this country need to stay six foot away from everybody that need to be washing their hand constantly and know where their hand are — to send a signal that we think a mask is equivalent to those piece so in the — when the advisory come out it will be an additive piece if it come out rather than saying “ this is a substitute for… and we want to make sure everybody understands it is not a substitute for the presidential guideline that have already gone out and to be absolutely clear about that dr birx can i ask a follow up about the testing please the president go ahead dr birx there ’ s a lot of evidence we ’ re seeing — that the expert are saying that a high number of these test could be producing false — false negative so — dr birx of the roche and abbott test that a many a one in three test might be providing false negative and i wa wondering — maybe you could explain or — dr birx that would be almost be impossible with — — tell a little about the science dr birx — having percent positive you — if that wa true you would have percent positive — are you concerned about the underlying data — dr birx — or percent positive so what i can tell you is the number of positive test is tracking very closely with the number of case diagnosed so i don ’ t — i will look into that i look at the roche and abbott number every night they ’ re trending exactly in the same way and that ’ s important when you ’ re validating data to really validate “ doe this same site ” — in other word i ’ m looking between testing site to see are there consistency is there an anomaly to make sure for what you just very specifically asked so i will go back and look at it more carefully i haven ’ t seen that kind of anomaly this is — this same platform is being used across the country and that ’ s a range from what i reported percent positivity up to percent positivity and that range reflects also what we ’ re seeing with the hotspot and the number of case and frankly – i mean we hate to talk about it but it also track with the hospitalization independent of diagnosis and the mortality that we ’ re seeing so all of those piece validate together there ’ s no concern that there might – people might be getting a false sense of security or that we might not be seeing all of the data here on – and who ha it dr birx well i ’ m telling you i ’ m still missing percent of the data from reporting i have test reported in we ’ ve done million so there is — and it could be those site so we do need to see all — the bill said you need to report we ’ re still not receiving percent of the test dr birx with regard to the test the president ’ s sample collection took one minute result reported back in minute i realize you ’ re the president of the united state but when will everyone get to take a test that work that quickly and you get result that quickly dr birx so these are new test and we have prioritized the group that we think have the least access to testing now and who do we mean by that we mean the indian health service — they ’ re often in remote area rural area the governor of the northwestern state that may not have the advantage of these highthroughput machine that are often across the east coast and in high metro area — colorado — and then across the west coast so we ’ ve prioritized the presidential test to the indian health service and public health lab so that they can support nursing home testing and other area where we think surveillance is absolutely key so at this moment they ’ re prioritized in that way the vice president it ’ s thirteen to twelve hundred dr birx yes of them are going out that way so do more of those test need to be made in order for more people — the president they are being made dr birx yeah okay so in a matter of – the president they ’ re moving very quickly — it ’ s happening — in this case dr birx so i ’ m glad you asked that because today there ’ s of these machine already out there we ’ re trying to find out exactly where everyone is because you can see that give you amazing flexibility because if people would allow it to be loaned to a state that ’ s in a hotspot or a state where you want to do additional surveillance test machine is a huge amount and it really get to your very question about how we can prioritize what we have at the same time we ’ re moving out what is new and so really figuring out who should those go to how — who can we ask community — because these will be in the community — to share those machine into the community who need the testing now and i think that ’ s really an incredible question that really need to be answered over the next hour dr birx a point of clarity about the facecovering guidance you said it ’ s still a point of debate you said — you used the phrase “ the guidance if it come out is the guidance coming out and when the vice president yes yes and — and when sir the vice president in the — in the day ahead we ’ re currently working through the task force taking the consultation advice of cdc our top health expert and we ’ ll be bringing forward the guidance from the cdc in the next several day dr birx just remember it ’ s not a substitute for everything that we ’ re asking people to do and just to — to everybody out there across the country when we say no gathering of we ’ re looking at — we want it to be clear if you have a family of we don ’ t want you to be split up but we don ’ t expect people to be having dinner party cocktail party i mean i know you ’ ve seen the slope in the united state versus the slope in italy and we have to change that slope we have to change the logarithmic curve that we ’ re on we see country after country having done that what it mean in the united state is not everyone is doing it so we ’ re only a strong a every community every county every state every american following the guideline to a t and i can tell by the curve and a it is today that not every american is following it and so this is really a call to action we see spain we see italy we see france we see germany when we see others beginning to bend their curve we can bend ours but it mean everybody ha to take that same responsibility a american mr president dr birx doe that mean — mr president can i have a quick followup on oil please in your conversation with russia and saudi arabia did you have to make any concession to get them to agree to cut their production the president no like did you agree to cut u production of oil the president no no we didn ’ t discus that they want to do that that ’ s good for their country and we did not discus that now mr president nbc news ha learned that the navy is set to fire the captain of the us theodore roosevelt after he raised red flag about the outbreak on his ship it appears a if he ’ s being punished for trying to save the life of the sailor in his command what ’ s your assessment the president oh i don ’ t think so at all but we ’ re going to wait a little while because i understand there ’ s a news conference by the secretary of defense about that but you know i don ’ t — i don ’ t agree with that at all not at all not even a little bit yeah mr president thank you this morning you said once again that new york got off to a late start and they should have pushed harder but governor and other state leader say they rely on the federal government to ass the situation and how risky it is and they want to know how would they have known to start sooner without your guidance the president well they have expert and frankly long after we came out and talked about it — look how would i have known to cut off china i cut off china very early and if i didn ’ t we would have a chart that you wouldn ’ t believe so how would i know to do that how would i know to cut off europe i cut off europe very early i mean you have to make a decision people knew that some bad thing were going on and they got off to a late start and some others got off to a late start also but we cut off china if we didn ’ t cut off china we would have been in some big trouble and we cut it off but do — the president and you know what we cut it off way early go ahead mr president to follow up on the insurance point and a separate question that came in from a colleague who can ’ t be in the room — the president too bad on the insurance point is there going to — the president who are you with who are you with roll call is there going to be an opportunity for insurance company — if in fact hospital are compensated for uncompensated care – the president right right — are the insurance company going to also get compensated for extraordinary expense that they may have or are they assuming that cost the president so we haven ’ t discussed it but we ’ re talking to them you know getting them not to pay copays in the case of the big one wa a tremendous thing that ’ s a lot of money they gave up but we ’ re discussing that with the insurance company okay the president we ’ ll let you know it ’ ll be pretty quickly yeah go ahead on — i have a question on japan sir they are expanding their entry ban to include the united state are you planning to take any similar action to ban japanese national from coming to the u a a result of this crisis the president well we ’ re looking at a lot of thing and a lot of different ban we have more ban than anybody we had ban when ban weren ’ t fashionable if you remember right at the beginning of this administration it wa for different reason but we ’ ve had ban long before people thought of ban when i did china it had never been done before i wa the first one to do it remember that it had never — according to what i read in all the paper this had never been done this is a terrible thing to do and four week later they were all saying “ we ’ re lucky we did it so we ’ re looking at it no we heard that and i think it ’ s fine that they do that they ’ re trying to protect their country and we have to protect our country yeah please mr president – mr president i asked you yesterday about stayathome order – the president yeah — and if that you know decision should be left in the hand of governor or if you ’ re considering telling the entire nation “ stay at home ” the president yeah so just today the — georgia ’ s governor finally issued a stayathome order – the president yeah — saying that individual could have been infecting people before they ever felt bad but we didn ’ t know that until the last hour is that ignorance gross incompetence the president he ’ s a good governor brian kemp he ’ s a very good – you ’ ve been having call with these governor the president he ’ s a good governor and he ha to make his own decision on that i let the state — i think we ’ re about percent positive on that if you look i think it ’ s about percent of the state have got the stayathome brian is a great governor we ’ ll — it ’ s his decision he made that decision ultimately he decided to go along with it do you think it wa smart decision to wait the president and they ’ re doing — and they ’ re doing well and the state is doing well in many respect yeah go ahead please this is another question from a colleague who couldn ’ t make it in today from emily goodin at the daily mail i had a question in regard to the russian plane that landed at jfk with medical supply did the united state ask russia for this aid or is it just accepting it the president we ’ re accepting it it wa a very nice offer from president putin i spoke to him the other night a i told you and they had excess medical equipment thing and i ’ ll take it i ’ ll take it he just offered you — the president i think it ’ s very nice we ’ ve had some from china we also help other country we like doing that like i said before if we have excess stuff we let it go out we let some go out where frankly they had order for it and i didn ’ t want to stop order it wa a very nice gesture on behalf of president putin and i could ’ ve said “ no thank you ” or i could have said “ thank you and it wa a large plane of very highquality medical supply and i said “ i ’ ll take it ” is he offering any further aid in your conversation the president i think he would if we asked for it but he wa very nice it wa part of the call he suggested — he said “ we have it it ’ s additional they have very big difficulty with this virus also a you know — russia i thought it wa a very nice gesture on behalf of president putin i could have said “ no i don ’ t want it ” or i could have said “ i ’ ll take it and you know what i said “ i ’ ll take it ” and would you accept further aid the president i think so yeah if they sent thing that we need i ’ d take it sure nice gesture are there concern about russian using it a propaganda the president i ’ m not concerned about russian propaganda not even a little bit he offered a lot of medical highquality stuff that i accepted and that may save a lot of life i ’ ll take it every day please in the back mr president you said — in january you tweeted that you stand with the people of iran since the beginning of your presidency and you ’ ll continue to stand with the people of iran given the fact that they ’ re so hard hit with the coronavirus — the president oh they ’ re very hard hit they ’ re very hard hit but would you consider — the president in a lot of way they ’ re hard hit they ’ re hit in — with their economy with their military and with obviously the virus they ’ re very hard hit would you consider easing sanction to allow medical supply to get in the president well they haven ’ t even asked u to do that okay but we know that sanction hit the people not the government the president you know what they haven ’ t even asked u to do that but how doe a person — the president if they want to meet we ’ d love to meet and we ’ d love to settle the whole thing out but i doubt they ’ ll be — but how doe a — realistically how doe a person in tehran pick up the phone and call you i mean — the president i think they love america i think the iranian love america i think they ’ d love to be free i think they ’ d love to have just some of the thing that we have you know i remember iran many year ago — friend of mine were always in iran they were doing real estate deal in iran they were building beautiful building all over iran apartment house it wa — they were very successful and then one day that came to an end but you know what the people of iran they remember that it wa a long time ago but not so long ago and they remember it and i ’ ll tell you they love america they love what we stand for and we ’ re not looking for cha — we ’ re not looking for government takeover government change you know this country ha been through that many time that doesn ’ t work so inaudible health of the people would you encourage other country to — who are maybe concerned about running afoul — the president well what i did — yeah what i did a you know — — of sanction to — the president — i put it out very publicly with respect to iran i said if they need help with respect to the virus we ’ d love to send — we have the greatest medical professional in the world we ’ d love to send them over so what country are you encouraging perhaps to — to lend their support because there are many country that feel — the president i ’ m not encouraging or discouraging they ’ ve been a very hostile country they made a deal that president obama should have never made it wa a shortterm deal giving them billion giving them billion in cash green fill up this room five time look — but your administration — do you have a moral responsibility to — the president no not at all nobody ha even asked me about it i have a moral responsibility to help them if they ask if they — if they needed help i would certainly consider different thing well the united nation say they need help the president well that ’ s up to the united nation i ’ m talking about u and what happens is if they wanted help — because they have a very big case of virus a very very big case it — one of the worst on earth if you believe what you ’ re reading and i happen to believe what i see and what i know and if they wanted help we ’ d give them help yeah you had one in the back please yes mr president and a question for jared too the — you talk about a granular approach to receiving data from these different state and region to try and figure out what they need the president — you just enacted the dpa on ventilator and mask are there are signal from across the country that might indicate there are other thing besides mask and ventilator that are slowly kind of rising in term of need — like hand sanitizer for instance the president go ahead mr kushner sure so the first — the first issue that we ’ ve been dealing with wa really the ventilator that wa the number one number two and number three from all the state what we ’ ve been finding is that people have a lot of these request based on the model and what we ’ ve been trying to do over at fema is say to the state “ well if you would like ventilator we need to see — first look in your state right so for example in northern jersey they ’ re going down to southern jersey and they ’ re finding ventilator and trying to relocate them to where they have their hotspot the second thing that we ’ ve done asked them to survey for alternative ventilator dr birx spoke before about the anesthesia machine and the ability to — to convert them to be ventilator so we ’ re asking people to be resourceful inside their state before they come to the federal government the third thing we ’ ve been asking state to do is to provide what their daily utilization rate are so everyone is asking for everything one congressman got a call from his local hospital saying “ i need ventilator and he said “ well you don ’ t have a covid patient within four county why do you want ventilator and he say “ well we just want to be safe we ’ re very nervous right now ” so what you have all over the country is a lot of people are asking for thing that they don ’ t necessarily need at the moment and the job of fema and admiral polowczyk ha been to try to make sure that we ’ re getting the real data from the city from the state so that we can make realtime allocation decision based on the data and right now what ’ s happening is a lot of the different city and state are providing fema that — that information we ’ re talking to them daily they ’ re updating that information daily and that ’ s enabling the federal government to make much more informed decision on where they position ventilator you also have a situation where in some state fema allocated ventilator to the state and you have instance where in city they ’ re running out but the state still ha a stockpile and the notion of the federal stockpile wa it ’ s supposed to be our stockpile it ’ s not supposed to be state stockpile that they then use so we ’ re encouraging the state to make sure that they ’ re assessing the need they ’ re getting the data from their local — local situation and then trying to fill it with the supply that we ’ ve given them the same thing with the mask so the mask is actually an item that wasn ’ t used a frequently in the medical profession before this it wa used mostly for disease so speaking to a lot of the doctor and hospital administrator they would say they used actually a very low percentage of the mask what the president and the vice president were able to do with congress wa to get the waiver so that you could expand the pool because a lot of the mask were used to — for the construction industry now there ’ s a much bigger pool of mask in the country there wa a stockpile they distributed that based on where they anticipated a lot of the need would go but a lot of that still is stuck with the state and it hasn ’ t trickled down to the right place within the state so i would just encourage you when you have governor saying that the federal government haven ’ t — hasn ’ t given them what they need i would just urge you to ask them “ well have you looked within your state to make sure that you haven ’ t been able to find the resource ” unlike other country a lot of the medical system in america is a private — it ’ s not a — it ’ s not a public governmentcontrolled so you have to get the data from what ’ s in their state look at it in that way and then make sure that they ’ re being resourceful in a way to do that and also ask them what their utilization percentage is because if one governor is asking for more ventilator and if the federal government sends them more than they need the goal here is not to have ventilator sitting in a warehouse where you have another state or you have people who need them so what we ’ re trying to do is make informed datadriven decision both on ventilator mask any other supply we can get to make sure it ’ s going to the people who need them i wonder if you could weigh in on the report of which i ’ m sure you ’ re aware where unnamed white house official have described your role a being something of running a shadow task force how do you describe your role how do you describe the qualification you bring to your role mr kushner yeah i would just say very simply — look the president asked the vice president to run the task force the vice president asked me to assist i ’ ve been serving really at the direction of vice president and he ’ s asked me to get involved in different project the vice president and i speak probably sometimes time a day but everything that i ’ m doing is at the direction of the vice president if some people are talking to you that mean they ’ re probably not informed a to what ’ s going on but i can assure you that i ’ m speaking with dr birx dr fauci the vice president and the president multiple time a day to make sure that i ’ m accomplishing and focusing on the objective that the vice president deems a priority jared a followup on the ventilator — the president or they don ’ t exist — and the national stockpile the president or the source don ’ t exist they ’ re fake person okay a lot of fake source out there they don ’ t exist i read about it — for a long time i ’ ve been reading a lot of them — fake source they don ’ t exist go ahead please thank you mr president jared what trigger sending a ventilator from the national stockpile to a state in other word how sick doe somebody have to be to get one of these national ventilator mr kushner well that ’ s not the issue that we ’ re — that ’ s not the criterion you have the state basically putting in the request and they ’ re giving u their utilization — their utilization percentage so it ’ s a very simple formula the state should know how many ventilator they have in their state and by the way some governor you speak to or senator they don ’ t know what ’ s in their state you know some governor i ’ ll speak to and they ’ ll know to the number how many ventilator they have in their state because that ’ s the first thing a good manager will do what a lot of the voter are seeing now is that when you elect somebody to be a mayor or a governor or a president you ’ re trying to think about who will be a competent manager during the time of crisis this is a time of crisis and you ’ re seeing certain people are better manager than others so what i would say is that the way that the federal government is trying to allocate is they ’ re trying to make sure a you have your data right don ’ t ask u for thing when you know that — when you don ’ t know what you have in your own state just because you ’ re scared you asked your medical professional and they don ’ t know you have to take inventory of what you have in your own state and then you have to be able to show that there ’ s a real need and so we prepositioned a lot of thing because most governor off the bat didn ’ t know what they needed but fema ha a joint command with admiral polowczyk admiral giroir and pete gaynor where every couple hour when their request come in they evaluate the request they all vote on the request and then if there is something that they want to elevate to the taskforce they bring it to the vice president to make a recommendation the vice president and jared if i may you might ask deborah to — we ’ re literally tracking hospitalization case on a daily basis interacting with governor and health system and that informs our supply chain decision dr birx yeah i really — i want to thank the health commissioner and all of them that have been sending hospital data and i think it ’ s really critical and important to all of u new york city ha been providing information new jersey connecticut rhode island and certainly louisiana in these hotspot and that allows u — we can see where they are with the rising number of case where they are in their curve what can be predicted and really ensuring that people get what they need a they need it and so i think many of the governor now and the health commissioner have been “ i had to use ” — “ i ’ m intubating people a day now i have enough for th next three day if that doubles…we ’ re seeing our hospitalization rate stabilizing but we still think there will be this many more in the next day that ’ s the information that they then translate into providing the ventilator so when you see the ventilator number going out they ’ re going out in and because i think early on we sent a big bolus out and then not all of them even today have been fully utilized and so we want to make sure every state and every hotspot can be reassured that ventilator are there for them a they move through the curve and i think to date we ’ ve been able to do that and i think that ’ s what ’ s important to me is that people have what they need when they need it and to date people who have needed ventilator have been able to get on ventilator and i think that ’ s our goal with governor and with the mayor to make sure that that continues to happen but that mean all of u have to work together and i think that ’ s what ’ s been really important over the last few week is people are not making generic request anymore they ’ re making datadriven request because they know precisely what ’ s happening in their hospital dr birx when you are up here a little bit ago you talked about the curve and what you ’ re seeing and you ’ re concerned that people are not abiding by the social distancing guideline i mean you seemed in your voice to be quite concerned about that ha the curve changed enough at this point where that to people are likely to die ha that shifted upwards at all dr birx no it ’ s just when i look at what — so we ’ re in week in our guideline and i guess what i expected when the president put out guideline that said “ don ’ t go to bar don ’ t be in group more than people ” when we said that now over day ago that wa serious and then you could see what happened subsequently and you can see the number of individual have been infected since then because the people we ’ re seeing infected today and in hospital today were infected after the guideline went out so that ’ s what we ’ re worried about and we ’ re worried about that we ’ re not — we ’ re still in this and that ’ s why the president extended it for day but we have to get out of this we have to start seeing this the president but deborah aren ’ t you referring to just a few state because many of those state are dead flat i mean so — dr birx yes the president so it ’ s hard to get — it ’ s hard to be — dr birx yes there are state that are dead flat but you know every — what change the curve is a new detroit a new chicago a new new orleans a new colorado those change the curve because it all of a sudden spike with the number of new case because you have a certain projection of new case and then a whole other city come on top where they ’ re in their logarithmic phase so those one that i talked about that had test result greater than percent positive all of those — all of those state or all of those county are in logarithmic phase that mean there are a lot of county that aren ’ t and we are really — we ’ re excited about those county that have been testing and still finding quite flat and hopefully maybe sunday or so or sometime this weekend we can go through all the state and the curve again so you can see where you know that california and washington are still steady but we ’ re watching very carefully because we see that you can go from this to this very quickly and what — this should not be happening any longer in new place if people are doing the social distancing washing their hand not getting together in large group more than the president again so i look at the graph all the time dr birx yes you do the president and you have many many — dr birx yes the president — flatliners i call them “ flatliners i ’ m amazed at them and you have a couple that are up it ’ s hard to blame the flatliners for not doing a good job dr birx no no i don ’ t want to say that no i don ’ t — no thank you sir i don ’ t want — in fact i want to praise the state that — and i think i want to be able to call them out and show you their graph so you can see they ’ ve had steady small case they ’ re testing and they ’ re doing a lot of testing and their percent of testpositives are under percent i mean we have a whole group of state who are testing and their positivity rate is under percent we know what it look like on the logarithmic curve you ’ re in the percent then percent then percent and then percent that ’ s what we ’ re trying to prevent and it ’ s the metro area that are absolutely crucial in this and so if you ’ re in a metro area or you ’ re in a small city please make sure all of your friend and family are following the guideline that ’ s the best thing we can do the president no because i saw those pen going five minute ago they were so — they were thrilled and the fact is — yes we compare them to italy one place but we have many place that are — dr birx yes the president — really doing great and i think that ’ s what deborah meant she didn ’ t mean all of them so when you write your story tomorrow maybe you ’ ll write it correctly she wa talking about one state and another state is you know having a hard time it ’ s — and they ’ re closely associated and by the way the people are doing a very good job including the people that live there but when deborah wa talking about italy she wa talking about the one and then the other wa lower and then you have mostly state that have been unbelievable so she wasn ’ t talking about the average of everything she wa talking about an individual state which is i think still better than italy italy is having a hard time by the way spain is having a hard time france is having a hard time but our state generally speaking it ’ s like lot of different country all over we have — many of those country are doing a phenomenal job they ’ re really flat and i think that ’ s what you meant dr birx thank you sir the president i don ’ t know i don ’ t want to — i don ’ t want to speak for — but i thought — that ’ s what i understood she meant yeah please can i ask a question about that though because coronavirus is present in all state you said before that you — when you implored mayor and governor to be serious about this you said “ once it show up mitigation effort are too late ” so how do you then square that with this notion that some state are doing well i mean the virus doesn ’ t abide by state law the president because some state they stay in better they ’ re not touching they ’ re not — whatever it is they ’ re not going out they ’ re not in group and some state are not probably a good or for whatever reason or they also live a lot closer you know new york is very dense and you know california is pretty dense too and they ’ ve got a very good record going so far we hope it doesn ’ t spike up but it ’ s very flat we have state that are doing incredibly well i mean when i looked at some of them i looked at some state that i would have thought maybe wouldn ’ t have done a well and they ’ re really flatlined hope they stay that way i hope they stay that way isn ’ t that the point mr president the president say it jeff sir isn ’ t that the point that you want those state to stay flatlined the president i want them — yeah that ’ s what i ’ m saying i mean it seems like you ’ re — the president no no no but when deborah mentioned about italy and our country she wasn ’ t referring to our country she wa referring to one state but she ’ s encouraging people to do a better job of following these social distancing measure that ’ s what i ’ m understanding it the president okay so my understanding — i ’ m going to let her say it but i think that everybody would have to be thrilled with the way most state are doing thrilled i don ’ t think she — is that what you meant the president the flatline — the flatline state — state that have almost no bump i mean i would think now then you have others where for whatever reason they ’ re higher that ’ s different but you can ’ t condemn people living in a flatliner with people living in something where there ’ s the big bump or the bigger bump or more akin to italy where they have some very unique problem in all fairness to italy they have some very unique problem but if you ’ d like to come up and — so how many flatline do we have the president a lot of them and how many do we have — how many how many do we have dr birx so why don ’ t i bring you the whole deck again and we ’ ll divide out the state so you can see them the vice president we ’ ll do it tomorrow dr birx because you really have to see each state separately that ’ s why i started with there are state where you ’ ve heard me talk about how concerned i wa these are state that before the guideline went out or right after the guideline went out — i mean you can look at — it ’ s on the website if you go to the healthdataorg about when governor made clarity about closing their state a far a the social distancing the washing of the hand the bar the taking — doing takeout and you can line that up with the presidential guideline and not all state when the presidential guideline came out immediately followed the presidential guideline not all state did there are state that also may have gotten many more seed from outside community that certainly is one of the issue that new york and new jersey connecticut and rhode island are facing the virus came in from multiple place into those state it wa undetected early on and they have a very logarithmic curve what i am saying is even one of those curve in one county in one city is one curve too many so i am passionate about everyone following the guideline because of the outlier curve maybe that wa a better way of putting it the president yeah that ’ s exactly — dr birx the outlier curve — the president i think that ’ s perfect dr birx — in specific county is to make sure that doesn ’ t happen anywhere else so would you feel better if every state did a stayathome order would you feel better dr birx well i think most of the state have done that i think if you — one death from this is one death too many i mean i come out of epidemic and pandemic we know what to do i know we don ’ t have a vaccine and i know we don ’ t have a therapeutic but we know what can be done and others are doing it and most of the people in the united state are doing it it ’ s our community — it ’ s every american that ha to make these change and i know they ’ re really hard and i know it ’ s hard to remember i mean i have to say to myself every day because i ’ m around very important people to like never touch anything and i ’ m just like paranoid now about touching thing i ’ m sure you all are too i mean we ’ ve gotten to the place where we don ’ t go to your place on pebble beach we go to the one that ’ s open aired because i mean you ’ re trying to protect your reporter i mean i understand that we ’ re all trying to protect each other and we all have to adapt to this new reality that we ’ re in right now and i believe everybody is trying really hard and i ’ m just asking them to try really really hard for these next day because they will make a tremendous difference we see that evidence and so it ’ s like having a vaccine or a therapeutic because we know what work and we ’ re asking everybody to apply what work and i know it take amazing attention to detail because you know the minute you forget or do something you ’ re like “ oh my gosh i should have never done that ” and that ’ s the level of attention it take if covering our face could help u do that and guideline are coming out — the president so i just want to say — look many state have started low and slow and then they stayed at a good level some really stayed at a great level some — louisiana a an example it wa low and slow and they were looking great i wa watching it because you know it ’ s kind of a place people go to with mardi gras — which sort of is an interesting point because after mardi gras it wa low and then all of a sudden it went up very rapidly and now it ’ s one of our true hotspot right certain area of michigan — detroit wa — it looked like it wa doing pretty good and then all of a sudden it went up so you have that too but i ’ ll tell you what we have state that have been really incredible in the fact that they have kept so — so low they have not — you haven ’ t seen the bump and i hope you don ’ t i hope you don ’ t and you have a couple that for a lot of different reason — and that ’ s not to blame anybody but they are at a higher level but very few i think deborah — i mean i may say i think most people have actually followed the presidential — you can call them whatever you want i would never use the word “ dictate ” because if i used that word i would be in such trouble in fact you ’ ll put me in trouble just that i even mentioned the thought of it okay but we make a recommendation and i think they ’ ve done a good job and maybe they started a little later but maybe they ’ re also more difficult state but we ’ ve done i think on average really phenomenally a a country i think we ’ ve done phenomenally because when you looked at that graph the other day — i don ’ t know if you saw it i assume you saw it everybody in the world saw it but you look at all those line on the bottom — one color after another all different representing different state — it ’ s all crowded at the bottom and then you had two that were up but you had — i don ’ t know almost every one of them wa down low very low so there were a lot of people listening and i just did — i want to be clear because i don ’ t need headline tomorrow and neither doe the country because i don ’ t want this country working so hard and then have press that is in this case maybe misinterpret something because i might have — i might have — when i heard it i wa surprised at first too but i understood what deborah meant mr president — can you clear something else up again the president but i think it ’ s very important — because i think it ’ s very important for you to be accurate one other thing just a quick thing so what i found is when governor call me — i mean i think in every case they ’ ve always been so nice so nice and i ’ ve seen them and heard them say “ thank you very much you have done a great job ” “ a fantastic job ” in one case “ thank you thank you thank you then i ’ ll see the governor usually of the opposite party in almost all case except maybe one — but in almost all case they ’ re very generous they ’ re very nice they thank me everything is great we ’ re doing a great job and then i ’ ll see them on television and just like a different person and i realized there are some people because of politics that if they say “ we want ventilator ” and i ’ ll say “ no jim i want to give you ventilator they ’ ll say “ thank you you are the greatest president that ’ s ever lived and then i ’ ll see them quoted in a paper or see them on a show and they ’ ll say “ the president didn ’ t come through for me i ’ m very disappointed in the president ” and we have a lot of that they ’ re very happy when they talk to me and then i see them but there are some people if they asked for of something and if i gave them they will say — you ’ ll say “ how ’ s the president doing “ well we don ’ t like the job to my face they ’ re very nice but then sometimes — i guess they assume i don ’ t watch them or something but i watch very closely yeah please mr president one especially vulnerable population is the prison population and that ’ s — especially with jared here i wondered if you could address what the federal government is doing to protect inmate the president well it ’ s vulnerable in that it ’ s close together really i — i can ’ t tell you about age but a lot of young people in prison some people — some state — i have not done that at all but some state are letting people out of prison some people are getting out that are very serious criminal in some state and i don ’ t like that i don ’ t like it but it ’ s a city or state thing in certain case a you know i think maybe philadelphia come to mind so we ’ ll see you have to see what what ’ s going on and we don ’ t like it the people don ’ t like it and we ’ re looking in to see if i have the right to stop it in some case okay mr president million american filed for unemployment last week we haven ’ t heard you talk a lot today about what they ’ re going through so what ’ s — the president oh i think it ’ s — — your message to them and — the president i think they ’ re going through i think it ’ s terrible so look four week ago we had the greatest economy in the history of the world the greatest in the world — greatest in the history of the world we had the most job ever in the history of the united state almost million job right and then one day i get a call from deborah who ’ s fantastic and from dr fauci and he said and she said “ we have a problem i said “ what ’ s the problem and they said “ we may have to close it up i said “ close what up they said “ close up the country and i said “ what ’ s that all about and we discussed today — and probably not since we came to that conclusion — and she is a fantastic person a brilliant person and this is what she know i said “ ha it ever been this bad and i think i can represent that you said “ no and part of it — it ’ s a contagion it ’ s so contagious it ’ s like if you sneeze i probably get it whoever heard of a thing like that okay and this very talented reporter is bailing out okay he ’ s out of here i don ’ t blame you but it ’ s a very contagious thing and — probably the like of which we ’ ve never seen in term of that but — so that ’ s over year ago but that wa — you know it ’ s been written about many many time that wa a horrible — whether it wa or million people — i ’ ve heard from to i ’ ve heard to — but it wa ten of million of people now we have the advantage of communication this could have been just a bad i mean here we can read on the internet we can see what to do we can have these meeting they can watch on television which they do a lot of people are watching a lot of people are watching and they say “ gee social distancing ” but in they didn ’ t have that option you know they didn ’ t know what to do they just noticed people were dying all over the place think of it to million people died a lot of people in this country died i always — to me it ’ s a great — it ’ s a great question how come more people didn ’ t die in this country and they say it actually started in this country and went to europe i mean we lost a lot of people but relatively we lost very few compared to europe so this is a terrible thing that happened and what ’ s happening now with people and job — so think of the position i ’ m in we have built all together everybody — not me everybody — the greatest economy in history and all of a sudden people come in that we respect and we know and here ’ s the thing they were right everybody questioned it for a while not everybody but a good portion questioned it they said “ let ’ s keep it open let ’ s ride it if we did that — you saw the other graph and whether it ’ s true or almost true or maybe not true enough — the number wa million people would have died million people would have died in a short period of time in fact the graph could have been even shorter i always noticed that that horrible one — where it go high — it actually come down a little bit faster it might have been over faster and you would have lost million people so they come in and they say “ we have to close up the country and i say “ you know what that doe to this — to the fabric of this country to people that had great job great family no problem with money their — everything is perfect then all of a sudden they go from that to having no job in one day they never even thought of it and then you see million people unemployed unemployment number get released and you see million people and it ’ s an artificial closing it ’ s not like we have a massive recession or worse it ’ s artificial because we turned it off think of all we ’ re doing we ’ re saying “ don ’ t go to work and we ’ ll pay you everything is the opposite it wa always “ go to work and make a lot of money and do well and — the american dream because of a hidden enemy we ’ re saying “ don ’ t go to work and we ’ re going to pay you ” look at the money trillion and we will probably do more i think infrastructure would be a fantastic thing to do you want to get the restaurant back you give deductibility you understand what that is you give deductibility for business where they go and they use the restaurant the restaurant will be bigger and better than they were before you know people don ’ t know a lot of restaurant closed when they ended deductibility and then they started doing well but they had fewer restaurant but the boom of the restaurant is when they had deductibility where corporation could use them so — and entertainment that wa a great thing but they closed it and then they closed it again and it wasn ’ t the same but if you want to get them back you do that but infrastructure we borrow our money now at zero you know if were paying percent percent percent it ’ s a different ballgame we ’ re borrowing — we can borrow long term for zero — literally zero you know that — because we ’ re considered the safe investment all over the world they want money in the united state that ’ s where they want the money so i know better than anybody i just — i know what they ’ re going through and it ’ s horrible but you know what i want to do i want to be able to get them back fast when this is over it ’ s going to be a day we ’ re going to celebrate because everyone is going to go to work and i think we ’ re going to have boom time i think it ’ s going to be great and we ’ ve learned a lot we ’ ve learned about border we ’ ve learned about reliance on other country we ’ ve learned so much — so much that i think we really have a chance to be bigger and better and stronger and i think it ’ s going to come back very quickly but first we have to defeat this enemy so we will see you tomorrow thank you very much thank you end pm edt   \n",

president and the president you know today mr president i want to thank you especially for the work that secretary mnuchin have do especially for small businesses just today alone i saw bank of america have more than loan in two hours and for anybody who ’ s in small business — my first small business be when i be years old you don ’ t have income come in right now you get a loan but for your rent pay your employees and pay your utilities be a grant that ’ s part of the care act and i think you ’ re go to find that a lot of small businesses be go to hire people back keep them afloat through the next two months and get this economy move again as we get through this virus so i just want to thank you for all that work the president thank you great job you ’ re do leader mccarthy thank you the president thank you you go ahead i ’ ll talk to you later okay thank you very much everybody and i want to start by say that our hearts go out to the people of new york as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in america that seem to be the hotspot right now but you have some others as you know that be very — very bad very bad louisiana be get hit very hard part of michigan be get hit very very hard new jersey be — be –surprisingly it ’ s much greater than anybody would have think they ’ re do a really good job the governor be do a really good job out there new york ’ s first responders emts doctor nurse be show incredible courage under pressure they ’ re the best in the world we will take every action and we ’ ll spare no resource — financial medical scientific we will not spare anything we ’ ll get it back into shape the empire state — the governor be do an excellent job they ’ re all work very hard together at the request of the governor as you know the javits center we have bed and we ’ re go to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be look after the patients can be look after that be go to be for regular medical problems such as accidents and you know it ’ s very interest the governor be tell me we don ’ t have too many accidents and very few people drive so we ’ re go to put that facility into play which be a big facility the ship will be stay the way it be but we ’ re put that facility into play to help them and today also the cdc be announce additional step americans can take to defend against the transmission of the virus from recent study we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms be play a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understand so you don ’ t seem to have symptoms and it still get transfer in light of these study the cdc be advise the use of nonmedical cloth face cover as an additional voluntary public health measure so it ’ s voluntary you don ’ t have to do it they suggest for a period of time but this be voluntary i don ’ t think i ’ m go to be do it but you have a lot of ways — you can look at it as follow the cdc be recommend that americans wear a basic cloth or a fabric mask that can be either purchase online or simply make at home probably material that you ’ d have at home these face cover can be easily wash or reuse i want to emphasize that the cdc be not recommend the use of medicalgrade or surgicalgrade mask and we want that to be use for our great medical people that be work so hard and do some job medical protective gear must be reserve for the frontline healthcare workers who be perform those vital service the new mask guidelines also do not replace cdc ’ s guidance on social distance include stay in your home when possible stand at least six feet apart for a period of time again we ’ re go to all come back together here we ’ re go to all come back together and practice hand hygiene which we should do anyway a lot of things i think be go to spill over shake hand maybe will stay with our country for a long time beyond this one of the — one of our great doctor be tell me that — as you know we have flus every year and the number of people kill by the flu be very substantial and say that if they didn ’ t shake hand that number would be substantially lower so maybe it ’ ll stay maybe some of these things long term will be good but those guidelines be still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection so with the mask it ’ s go to be really a voluntary thing you can do it you don ’ t have to do it i ’ m choose not to do it but some people may want to do it and that ’ s okay it may be good probably will they ’ re make a recommendation it ’ s only a recommendation it ’ s voluntary we ’ re also take action to ensure the cost of no barrier to any american seek test or treatment of the coronavirus the largest insurer nationwide the bluecross blueshield system have now announce that it will not require any copays — which be really something that ’ s a tremendous statement — from patients of the virus treatment for the next days similar to the commitments of cigna humana anthem those be great company and they ’ re all do the same thing so copays for them to do that be — it ’ s a big statement we appreciate it today i can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treat uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimburse by the federal government use fund from the economic relief package congress pass last month so that be as per the question yesterday and actually the day before yesterday this should alleviate any concern uninsured americans may have about seek the coronavirus treatment so that ’ s i think answer the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people i ’ m also sign a directive invoke the defense production act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supply by unscrupulous actors and profiteer the security and secretary — the secretary of homeland security will work with fema to prevent the export of respirators surgical mask gloves and other personal protective equipment we need these items immediately for domestic use we have to have them but we ’ ve do really well with the purchase of items and you ’ ll be hear about that shortly we ’ ve already leverage the dpa to stop the hoard and price gouge of crucial supply under that authority this week the department of health and human service work with the department of justice take custody of nearly respirators surgical mask gloves as well as bottle — many many many bottle — and disinfectant spray that be be hoard all of this material be now be give to healthcare workers most of it have already be give out and we ’ ve give a lot to new york a lot in new jersey a lot to other place in addition to ensure that healthcare workers in new york have the protective equipment they need the federal government in the name of the department of defense be provide about million respirators department of defense and we ’ ve already give of them to new york city mayor de blasio need them very badly so we get them to mayor de blasio in new york city and they be very grateful million and we ’ re go to be increase that number from million to more that ’ s a lot of respirators today my team speak with the ceo of ochsner health and the ceo of lcmc the two largest health systems in new orleans they say they feel that they currently have enough ventilators — i think a lot of people be go to have enough ventilators — and mask and appreciate what we do and all of the things we ’ ve be do with them work with them the ceo of ochsner warner thomas — who ’ s really be fantastic i have to say — indicate a need for surgical gown and i instruct fema to deliver them tomorrow so they ’ ll have the that ’ s louisiana — new orleans two hundred and thirty thousand surgical gown they ’ ll have them by tomorrow we ’ re expand the role of the arm force in our response effort because no one be better prepare to win a war than the unite state military and we be in a war the invisible enemy — remember over retire army medical personnel have answer their nation ’ s call and be now support field hospitals and medical facilities all across the country like what i just tell you that governor cuomo request we do something in javits where we take it over and we ’ re go to have that man by the military because it ’ s very tough to get people — more people in the new york area so we ’ re go to have it man by the military — javits center national guard members have be activate to help state build new treatment center and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supply that include national guard the national guard be assist very strongly because the state be in many case unable to have the delivery capability from warehouse and other place that we put the supply so i ’ ve give approval to use the national guard — the various national guard in the different state and they ’ re do a fantastic job of not only protect people but deliver material the army corps of engineer have assess more than facilities in all state and be rapidly build temporary hospitals and alternative care sit in many state in new york new jersey michigan pennsylvania arizona california colorado florida illinois new mexico oregon washington wisconsin ohio they ’ re do a lot of work in just those state plus additionals that be be — will be announce probably tomorrow but they ’ re do some job the army corps of engineer — what a job they ’ re do and fema — what a job they ’ re do as we deploy the power of our military we ’ re also deploy the skill of our doctor scientists and medical researchers we continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies and the treatment and prevention of the virus and we will keep the american people fully inform on our find hydroxychloroquine — i don ’ t know it ’ s look like it ’ s have some good result i hope that — that would be a phenomenal thing but we have it right now in — approximately now it ’ s increase to people i speak with dr zucker in new york — terrific guy by the way he ’ s — we ’ re do a good job and i speak to governor cuomo last even and this morning about it so it ’ s be there for about three and a half days but i think — and many other place it ’ s be test too and we have a tremendous supply of it we ’ ve order it in the case that it work and it ’ s — it could have some pretty big impact and we ’ ll see what happen my administration be also work to get relief to american workers and businesses on day one of the paycheck protection program as kevin say more than billion in guarantee loan have be process to help small businesses keep their workers employ during the unprecedented time — this unprecedented time and bank of america have be incredible of the big bank bank of america have really step forward and do a great job and then you have the community bank your smaller bank and we ’ re already at billion go out to incredible people but that ’ s way ahead of schedule the sba and the treasury be work around the clock and our bank partner be really incredible and they ’ re ensure that the money get to small businesses as quickly as possible and then the small business in turn take care of employees that they would have have to let go and now they ’ ll keep them and that ’ s good and then they ’ re go to open for business and they ’ re go to have their employees and we ’ ll try and get back to where we be eventually we ’ re go to supersede where we be the energy industry have be especially hard hit in the crisis this afternoon i meet with greg garland of phillips dave hager of devon energy harold hamm of continental resources jeff hildebrand of hilcorp energy vicki hollub of occidental petroleum mike sommers of the american petroleum institute kelcy warren of energy transfer partner mike wirth of chevron and darren woods of exxon mobil i inform them that we will be make space available in the strategic petroleum reserve to let american producers store surplus oil that can be sell at a later time there ’ s a tremendous abundance of oil primarily because of the virus the virus have just stop demand of everything include oil so we ’ re work with our great energy company these be great company they employ tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people and they ’ ve keep america really go for a long time and no big price hike no big anything i mean they ’ ve just keep it go and now they get hit but with all the job and all of the good that they do we ’ re go to make sure that they stay in good shape america be engage in a historic battle to safeguard the live of our citizens our future society our greatest weapon be the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time and we want them to stay healthy for a long time so stay at home this be end

president ’ s coronavirus guidelines — be have a positive effect in fact today california and washington state where the coronavirus first emerge in our country remain — the case remain at a steady but low rate and we know as governor newsom say yesterday that they ’ re not out of the woods yet we continue to flow resources but we want to commend people in those state and all across the country who be put into practice the social distance and all the measure that state and local leaders be advise and that — and that the president have be advise in the coronavirus guidelines for america we ’

again in near record time — have approve an antibody test develop by cellex and we ’ re continue on the white house coronavirus task force to examine ways that we can scale up these rapid test and these innovative new test not just to meet this moment but to lay a foundation for test across the nation in the months ahead as the president mention he meet with energy executives today and continue to engage with leaders of businesses all across the nation we also have hold a teleconference today with commercial retailers on the president ’ s behalf we thank them for the way that people that operate malls and shop center around the country have embrace and enact the coronavirus guidelines for america it ’ s have enormous impact on their businesses and their industries but i hear — i hear from them their — their patriotic commitment to put the health of their associate and their customers first and it be deeply inspire on the subject of supply the president detail our work in that space it continue to this day as part of our air bridge we have a flight arrive from china today to columbus ohio we continue to work each and every day watch the data about case to ensure that in particular not just the personal protective equipment be available for the healthcare workers that be on the frontlines but also that ventilators be available as the — as this epidemic make its way through regions and communities we be literally work hour by hour day by day to make sure that patients families and healthcare providers have the equipment and the support that they need as the president mention we ’ ve see over a billion and a half dollars in loan go out through the paycheck protection program today we have available for question the head of the cdc today to speak about the new guidance on cloth face cover and secretary azar in a few moments will explain just how the president ’ s decision to make sure that no american will ever have to worry about pay for test or for coronavirus treatment i ’ m please to report at the president ’ s direction medicaid and medicare already expand to coronavirus treatment and test early on and of course the president just indicate how major insurance company across the country be not just waive copays on test but they ’ re now waive copays for at least days on any coronavirus treatment but now as secretary azar will enumerate now we ’ ll make sure that any american even those that have no insurance will be able to receive treatment in a hospital and never have to worry about the bill i ’ ll just give a general reminder to every american there be evidence across the country that you ’ re put into practice the coronavirus guidelines for america every american have a role to play and i want to thank you on behalf of the president and all of the american people for the way that you ’ re step forward you ’ re engage in the social distance and do the things that will slow the spread we encourage you to keep on keep on and we will get through this america we will get through the coronavirus to that day of renew health and renew prosperity that the president always describe but we ’ ll get through there sooner and we ’ ll get through there when we work together dr birx dr birx thank you mr vice president mr president thank you for your word of discipline and determination i guess that really describe what we ’ re ask every american to really be discipline about these guidelines and really determine to stay in that space of execution you know we be just in week three on — of this full guidance measure we really do appreciate the work of the citizens of california and washington state because we do see that their curve be different their curve be different from new york new jersey and connecticut and we really believe that the work that every citizen be do in those state be make a difference and it will make a difference for the frontline healthcare providers we also be deeply grateful despite the way their curve look today they continue to get ready for a different potential so that they can ensure that patients if they do get sick have options and availability to all the frontline healthcare workers in the — what we have refer to as “ hot zone ” — areas where the number of case be quite significant — the new orleans the new york city metro area include new jersey and connecticut — the incredible work that the frontline healthcare workers be provide we ’ re really work now at a much more granular level talk directly to hospitals to ensure that they have the supply that they need in coordination with state and local governments and to work — i think we discuss it yesterday but i think it be quite clear also — and reiterate by governor cuomo today — that we have to support one another as each of these different metro areas and other areas move through their peak of new infections when we talk about it at the begin of this week we talk about this week and next week be incredibly difficult and we want to recognize the number of americans who have lose their live to this virus and recognize the sacrifice that healthcare providers be make both in their care but i think i ’ m very uplift by hear their message to families and their compassion for others to provide that kind of support to the individuals in the hospital we continue to watch in addition the chicago area the detroit area and have some develop concern around colorado the district of columbia and pennsylvania so as you can see each of these will follow their own curve we ’ ll be get more and more of those case over time information in a very granular way to each and every one of you so that we can follow these epidemiologic curve as each of these state counties and communities move through this together in solidarity and really ensure that we can move supply creatively around the country to meet the need of both the frontline healthcare providers but also every american who need our support right now thank you the president thank you very much secretary azar well thank you mr president for your continue leadership as we battle the coronavirus first i want to thank all of the members of the hhs team and the frontline healthcare workers across america include those who — those service workers who serve in our hospitals at our healthcare facilities those who clean those who deliver those who stock the shelve — all those who be go into battle every day against the virus your country have ask you to serve as never before and you have respond heroically i ’ m go to provide a brief update on the administration ’ s plan to cover the test and treatment for the uninsured get the uninsured access to the care they need be a top priority for president trump we be already roll out the billion in fund from the families first coronavirus response act to cover providers ’ expense for test and diagnose the uninsured the care act sign by the president include another billion for healthcare providers under the president ’ s direction we will use a portion of that fund to cover providers ’ cost of deliver care for the uninsured send the money to providers through the same mechanism use for test as a condition of receive fund under this program providers will be forbid from balance bill the uninsured for the cost of their care providers will be reimburse at medicare rat we will soon have more specifics on how the rest of the billion will go to providers we ’ re work to ensure that this fund be distribute in a way that be fast fair simple and transparent i ’ d also like to remind people that if you ’ ve lose employer insurance coverage you have insurance options that you should look into you ’ d be eligible for a special enrollment period on the healthcare exchange and depend on your state you may be eligible for medicaid just as president trump be work to ensure that treatment be pay for he ’ s work to support new treatment options for patients thank to the president ’ s leadership many providers be try different experimental therapies and we need as much data as we can collect as quickly as possible on how these treatments be work today oracle have develop and be donate to the government and the american people a web portal and platform to gather crowdsourced realtime information from providers about how patients respond to potential therapeutics while this doesn ’ t replace the important work of clinical trials it give us data rapidly if you be a doctor or a healthcare provider and you would like to help us you can sign up today to begin report on your work there ’ s a special registration page for providers at thank you very much the president thank you very much okay let ’ s go steve if we could draw you out a little bite more on the advice on face mask what do — what would people gain from wear a mask and why be you oppose to wear one yourself the president well i just don ’ t want to wear one myself it ’ s a recommendation they recommend it i ’ m feel good i just don ’ t want to be do — i don ’ t know somehow sit in the oval office behind that beautiful resolute desk — the great resolute desk — i think wear a face mask as i greet presidents prime minister dictators kings queen i don ’ t know somehow i don ’ t see it for myself i just — i just don ’ t maybe i ’ ll change my mind but this will pass and hopefully it ’ ll pass very quickly now with that be say if somebody want to — i mean most people can just make something out of a certain material so it ’ s very well designate it ’ s very simple to do i win ’ t be do it personally it ’ s a recommendation okay and would you like to say something about that surgeon general adams sure absolutely the president surgeon general please surgeon general adams well thank you mr president mr vice president mr secretary and cdc director redfield i especially want to thank the folks at the cdc and it ’ s a great question that you ask it ’ s a fair question that you ask i want to unpack the evolution of our guidance on mask because it have be confuse to the american people first of all i want people to understand that the cdc the world health organization my office and most public health and health organizations and professionals originally recommend against the general public wear mask because base on the best evidence available at the time it be not deem that that would have a significant impact on whether or not a healthy person wear a mask would contract we have always recommend that symptomatic people wear a mask because if you ’ re cough if you have a fever if you ’ re symptomatic you could transmit disease to other people what have change in our recommendation well it ’ s important to know that we now know from recent study that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms they ’ re what we call asymptomatic and that even those who eventually become presymptomatic mean that they will develop symptoms in the future can transmit the virus to others before they show symptoms this mean that the virus can spread between people interact in close proximity for example cough speak or sneeze even if those people be not exhibit symptoms in light of this new evidence cdc recommend and the task force recommend wear cloth face cover in public settings where other social distance measure be difficult to maintain these include place like grocery store and pharmacies we especially recommend this in areas of significant communitybased transmission it be critical and the president mention this the vice president mention this it ’ s critical to emphasize that maintain six feet of social distance remain key to slow the spread of the virus but cdc be additionally advise the use of simple cloth cover to slow the spread of the virus and to help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmit it to others the cloth face cover recommend be not surgical mask or respirators those be critical supply that must continue to be reserve for healthcare workers and other medical first responders as recommend by the current cdc guidance as the president also mention cloth face cover fashion from household items or make at home from common materials at low cost can be use as an additional voluntary public health measure this recommendation complement and do not replace the president ’ s coronavirus guidelines for america “ days to slow the spread ” which remain the cornerstone of our national effort to slow the spread of the virus cdc be always — always look at the data we tell you that from the begin — dr birx say it every single press conference — we ’ re look at the data we ’ re evolve our recommendations and new recommendations will come as the evidence dictate so i want to say if you do choose to wear a face mask — very important — wash your hand first because you don ’ t want to put on a face cover with a dirty hand do not touch your face while you be wear the face cover because again you could take materials from the surface germs from the surface and bring it to your face if you choose to wear a face cover please — please leave the mask the medical supply for the medical professionals healthcare workers and frontline workers know that this be not a substitute for social distance and remember this be all about me protect you and you protect me this be about us come together as communities and if people voluntarily choose to wear a face cover they ’ re wear it to protect their neighbor from get the coronavirus because again they could have asymptomatic spread so mr president thank you very much for that the president thank you thank you surgeon general adams appreciate the opportunity to update everyone the president great job thank you okay jon mr president dr fauci last night recommend — say that every state should have stayathome order right now do you agree with that should every state in this country have the kind of stayathome order that we now see in place like washington and new york the president i leave it up to the governors the governors know what they ’ re do they ’ ve be do a great job i guess we ’ re close to percent anyway and the state that we ’ re talk about be not in jeopardy no i would leave it to the governors i like — i like that from the standpoint of govern and i like that from the standpoint of even our constitution please mr president to address the shortage in the blood supply the food and drug administration announce yesterday — the president well i point to him right thank mr president the president i know we inaudible i hear a different voice i hear a different voice go ahead we ’ ll get you later go to the oil meet previously — the president yeah — be the us will to cut domestic oil production what come out of the meet what be the consensus the president well a lot of things come out it ’ s a great industry it ’ s an important industry it ’ s a tremendous jobproducing industry and it ’ s just vital and it be also very interest because they all be give the test before they come into the room so you have the head of exxon mobil you have all these guy take the test and they all pass with fly color so that be good they leave happy in that respect at least there ’ s just an overabundance of oil right now — oil and gas tremendous overabundance and it be cause — they be do a great job they be produce a lot of energy but then you have the virus come along and it knock another percent maybe percent off of the market so there ’ s too much oil there ’ s a glut and these be great company and they ’ ll figure it out it ’ s free market we ’ ll figure it out you speak to president putin i mean what ’ s on the table here with him — the president and with the crown prince both yeah the president they be have a competition we ’ ll see how it all work out i think it ’ s go to work out very well it ’ s go to take a long time to — to get rid of that there ’ s massive excess amount of oil and gas massive like probably there ’ s never be so where that do work out well i guess you could say be for drivers i think in certain locations it ’ s down to and cents a gallon right now on the road but we have a tremendous industry a great industry a tremendously important industry from the standpoint of job and we ’ re energy independent we have to make sure we keep it that way all right please go ahead mr president as i be say the food and drug administration to address the shortage of blood supply announce yesterday it would ease the restrictions on certain donors include gay men who be now require to be abstinent for months as oppose to months to donate do you have a hand in that change the president no i didn ’ t know anything about that that be do by the fda — very capable people at the fda please go ahead yes mr president both the government of canada and be push back on this dpa not to export respirators the president yeah say — the president i don ’ t blame them they can push back if they want yeah but they ’ re say — the president we ’ re not happy with we ’ re not happy and the people that deal with it directly be not at all happy with so we ’ ll see whether or not we do i hear what he have to say today i don ’ t know the gentleman but we ’ re not happy with go ahead and where be dr fauci the president i don ’ t know but every time you ask that question — whenever he ’ s not here you look you say “ where be he and you ’ ll say “ be there a problem no problem whatsoever every time he ’ s not here — sometimes i ’ ll ask him to come because that ’ s the first question that you and a couple of others from the fake news establishment ask be “ where be dr fauci we ’ re do great together a different subject if i may ask the president except we ’ re cover a different subject today go ahead a different subject if i may ask the president go ahead jim try another one mr president you have you have say nobody could have see this pandemic come but in fact secretary azar at a biodefense summit in april of say “ of course the people ” — “ of course the thing that people ask ‘ what keep you most up at night in the biodefense world ’ pandemic flu of course i think everyone in this room probably share that concern your own health and human service secretary be aware that this have the potential of be a very big problem around the world a pandemic of this nature who drop the ball the president well i always know that pandemics be one of the worst things that could happen there ’ s be nothing like this since probably that be the big one in europe it start actually here and go to europe probably i ’ ve hear about — you ’ ve also say nobody could see this come the president excuse me wait a minute let me finish i ’ ve hear about this for a long time — pandemics you don ’ t want pandemics and i don ’ t think he be talk about a specific pandemic he be talk about the threat of a pandemic could happen and it could happen most people think it wouldn ’ t and most people didn ’ t understand the severity of it this be a very severe what ’ s happen be very severe but i ’ d let you answer that i assume that he be talk about the concept of a pandemic secretary azar thank you mr president actually — absolutely for years now this country have have a massive effort at the federal state and local level of preparedness for a pandemic now that largely have be as i say in those remark about pandemic flu preparedness we know about sars we know about mers which be earlier modifications or variants of the coronavirus none of those achieve anything like what we ’ re see today but that ’ s why for successive presidencies include the leadership of president trump there have be a great focus on pandemic preparedness in fact it be just in november i believe that the president sign the pandemic flu preparedness executive order that we have — and we have also update the pandemic crisis action plan which have be the playbook from which we ’ ve be work the pandemic flu plan again the action plan from which we have be work that coordinate the wholeofgovernment wholeofeconomy approach here so we ’ ve all be very focus on pandemic preparedness that ’ s what we do but this particular strain of pandemic who would — who would have know this particular strain but secretary azar if you be prepare for a pandemic if this government be prepare for a pandemic why be it we don ’ t have enough mask why be it we don ’ t have enough medical equipment in this country the president previous administrations give us very little ammunition for the military and very little shelf space let me just tell you — but you ’ ve be president — the president you know it — you ’ ve be president — the president you know the answer — three or four years now the president the previous administration the shelve be empty the shelve be empty you have time to stock the shelve the president so what you should do be speak to the people from the previous administration jim and ask them that question because — mr president you ’ ve be in office — the president — the shelve be empty — for almost four years the president and you know what else the military shelve be also empty we have no ammunition literally and that be say by one of your favorite general “ we have — sir we have no ammunition guess what we have very little medical supply also all right go ahead please isn ’ t that a copout though the president go ahead isn ’ t that a copout the president we ’ ll get it back we ’ ll get you back but mr president — the president we ’ ll get you back please but what about that question — the president jim i say we ’ ll get you back please go ahead so i want to ask about the dpa so you say that there will be a ban on export of all — what do it cover so mask gloves what else be include in that order the president it cover everything and be you concern — the president but if somebody order — if italy if spain who have big problems — these have — these be countries with tremendous problems — france if they order — if they have longterm order and they ’ re in in there and they want to get certain things i ’ ve let them go out in certain instance because i think it ’ s only fair they have problems that be proportionately or relatively bigger than our problems so if they order something and they ’ re wait for as an example mask make here and go to italy i ’ m not go to be stop that i think it would be very unfair and by the way speak about be fair and unfair two very big cruise liners as you know i allow them to dock today we work with the governor of florida as you know ron desantis and we work on it and we have tremendous security and we take the sick people and we ’ re work with them we have doctor we have great doctor military doctor and from a humane standpoint not that we ’ re in love with this — these be two massive ship — but we have to take care of people we have to take care we send many back to canada the canada — the canadians come and work very closely with us as do the uk we have a lot of people from the uk and we take — we take care of the americans we take care of the sick we have some people very sick i think we have three to four maybe five people that have die on the boat one of the boat actually and we have to take care of these people so we couldn ’ t let them float aimlessly into the ocean look for port as they ’ ve be do for a long time and i make the decision we have to take them in and homeland security and a lot of other people do a great job but we have to help people these be people that be very very sick some be die some die please mr president on dpa — can i just finish please the president go ahead yeah go ahead mr president your staff they say that people in close proximity to you and the vice president will get a coronavirus test i ’ m wonder be you concern that the people you ’ ve be hang around with may have the virus the president no i ’ m not concern no i have a test yesterday but what ’ s the reason for the order for people who meet with you or talk to you why should they require coronavirus test the president i don ’ t know i mean i just — i hear from the oil executives these be people — most of them have not have the test and frankly i think they leave the room feel good about a lot of things but they felt good about the test this be a test that take i guess minutes to have it finalize they take the test i don ’ t know i didn ’ t know they be do that maybe they do it just for them i don ’ t know but — but they ’ re always go to have to have a test the president — it seem that a lot of people — because now we have test that really work well abbott in this case abbott we have other test be develop right now that be also fantastic the original test — the ones we inherit jim as an example they be — they be break they be obsolete they be not good test and that ’ s what we get stick with we ’ ve develop some incredible test but this take to minutes and they be all fine on the dpa sir — the president go ahead finish — finish your question thank you yeah so the problem some people have raise be that if the us stop export what you could have be other countries then decide reciprocally that they be go to stop export — the president sure — and that the result of that then will be a net decrease in the amount of supply that american doctor american hospitals have how do you address that the president well i address it in the follow manner we really be very well supply we be not the principal — it ’ s the hospitals the state the cities they ’ re suppose to get everything they can and stock up in case something like this happen but nobody could ever have assume that something like this happen so we start supply we bring tremendous amount to new york today and over the last few days we bring them to louisiana we bring them to michigan we bring them to los angeles a lot of equipment you ’ ve read the amount of mask that we have i think i say over million mask the mask the you know more expensive more complicate better whatever mask — the ones they want to use in the hospitals we have millions of them now and we ’ ve give them to a lot we send to bellevue in new york today — that be for mayor de blasio — of them but we have million we ’ re go to have more than that and we ’ re get them from various source include the military we ’ re rapidly then replace them because we have to replace them in case there ’ s a — another emergency i would be — gown too we have many gown be deliver and have be deliver our people have do an incredible job most people have say — now and i say this yesterday — governors have say “ thank you very much great job if they ’ re a democrat governor — in some case not in all case at all — if i say “ here ’ s ventilators how many do you want “ we want “ here ’ s you get ’ em but you know what we ’ re go to do we ’ re go to add another be that good they say “ wow that ’ s great and then if jim acosta go and say “ be you happy with the president “ no he should have give us that ’ s what ’ s happen you know why because that ’ s a standard political answer and that ’ s a shame because we have do a job like nobody have ever do a job but we ’ ve just deliver a lot of mask we ’ ve just deliver a lot of gown and protective gear but you know you ’ re talk about a massive — you ’ re talk about a massive number but as of this morning people be very very happy steve do oil executives ask you for a bailout of any sort the president no they didn ’ t ask for a bailout no what do they ask for the president it be really more of a discussion than ask we discu — you know we do discuss the concept of tariff because as you know this be a dispute among a couple of countries that i think they want to be able to get it solve they have a dispute they have a competition but they want to get it resolve russia — you mean tariff — tariff on — the president — and saudi arabia i think want to get it — — saudi and russia the president yeah i think they want to get it resolve i think they ’ re work very hard i mean they tell me they want to get it resolve they ’ re work very hard go ahead president trump thank you yesterday jar kushner say the notion of the federal stockpile be it ’ s suppose to be “ our ” stockpile it ’ s not suppose to be state stockpile that they then use what do he mean by “ our ” and — the president well why don ’ t you ask him and even the fact that taxpayers from every state pay for it — the president what ’ s that a “ gotcha ” “ i gotcha you use the word “ our ” no it ’ s not a “ gotcha what do he mean by it the president “ our ” — you know what “ our ” mean unite state of america that ’ s what it mean it mean — so it mean the state the president our our it mean the unite state of america and then we take that “ our ” and we distribute it to the state so why do he say it ’ s not suppose — the president not that we have to — — to be state stockpile that they then can use the president because we need it for the government and we need it for the federal government to give to the state the president but when the state be in trouble — no to also keep — then who be you give to if it ’ s not to the state the president to keep — to keep for our country because the federal government need it too not just the state but out of that we oftentimes choose — as an example we have almost ventilators and we be ready to rock with those ventilators we ’ re go to bring them to various areas of the country that need them but when he say “ our ” he ’ s talk about our country he ’ s talk — but he make the distinction the president excuse me and sir — the president he ’ s talk about the federal government i mean it ’ s such a basic simple question and you try and make it sound so bad it ’ s not bad i ’ m just try to — the president you ought to be — you ought to be ashamed of yourself — understand no — by the way secretary azar — the president you know what you ought to be ashamed it ’ s such a simple question he say “ our and “ our ” mean for the country and “ our ” mean for the state — but then he say it ’ s not suppose to be state stockpile the president — because the state be part of the country don ’ t make it sound bad don ’ t make it sound bad go ahead steve go ahead back here but mr president the hhs even change the language on the website the president you just ask your question you just ask your question in a very nasty tone i don ’ t think it be nasty the president let ’ s go i think you didn ’ t give me an answer the president please mr president — the president i give you a perfect answer you know it go ahead well just to follow up on that when we have the federal stockpile — i mean isn ’ t that design to be able to distribute to the state who need it the president sure but it ’ s also need for the federal government we have a federal stockpile and they have state stockpile and frankly they be — many of the state be totally unprepared for this so we have to go into the federal stockpile but we ’ re not an order clerk they have to have for themselves now some of the state be in good shape some of the state be not in good shape that ’ s probably something you could expect we have be help state we have be spend a tremendous amount of time effort and billions and billions of dollars on make sure that they have what they have i mean take new york we build them hospitals — i build them four hospitals — build them medical center send a ship with room and operate room and then on top of that give vast number of ventilators and vast number of surgical gown equipment mask everything else now they have a chance to order ventilators over the years they have a chance to order a very big — but they didn ’ t choose to do it we be there and we help them and i think the governor of new york be very thankful for the help that we give but we have a stockpile it ’ s a federal stockpile we can use that for state or we can use it for ourselves we do use it for the federal government we have a very big federal government go ahead so have you decide not to use your power to be essentially a traffic cop for all the essential medical supply that be need in this the president well we ’ re not a traffic cop we ’ re a humanitarian cop we help — it ’ s like the ship do you think we want to take two big ship into our country that have obvious problems and you know the problems i ’ m talk about so i have a decision to make do i take them in or do i save live okay do i take them in or do i save i decide to take them in and we have tremendous protection we have great doctor there to help the people they have four or five people that die that be as of last night they die on the ship we take care of it and now the people be in the process of — and many be already back in canada they ’ re back in the uk — unite kingdom and many of them be american citizens some be very sick we ’ re take care of the sick people we ’ re test all of the others very very carefully — very very carefully they be be test like you wouldn ’ t believe and we solve a humanitarian catastrophe you know why because nobody else would take the ship nobody else would take them so we dock him in i think fort lauderdale i think some people be wonder why you don ’ t say “ we ’ re the federal government and there ’ s a shortage of mask and other things and — the president we do say that — we ’ re go to — the president we do say that — sign off on every single shipment– the president we say we ’ re — we say and use the act — that need to go to place where it need to go ” the president excuse me we do say that and we use the act and we ’ ve use it a number of time very powerfully and a lot of time we don ’ t have to use it because we say “ we ’ re go to use it if you don ’ t do this or that ” and then we also have company that act incredibly well we have plenty of them — mostly them but we ’ ve use the act very powerfully and a lot of time you don ’ t have to exercise the act all you have to do be tell them “ look if you don ’ t do this we ’ re go to use the act ” and we ’ ve do a good job with it — maybe a great job yeah mr president there be news report that you want to sign the stimulus check that be go out here in several months be that right do you want to sign those check the president no me sign no there ’ s millions of check i ’ m go to sign them no it ’ s a trump administration initiative but do i want to sign them no the people be get — the people be get their money there ’ s a lot of stimulus go in a lot of different ways there ’ s also stimulus go for company that would — if it weren ’ t our government would not — and some company that be very strong a month ago again we have the strongest economy in the world we have our best ever we have probably the best economy in the history of the world bigger than china bigger than anybody and one day we have to say “ close it up stop everybody go home and you know what that ’ s pretty tough to do that that ’ s another thing — that there be rumor that these check may not go out for another four months like if you don ’ t have a direct deposit the president i don ’ t know all i can tell you be the small business today be — we ’ re way ahead of schedule there be a problem where — and — which i point out i say “ you shouldn ’ t do it this way ” — with unemployment where equipment by the state we ’ re send the money to the state once the money be send to the state then the state whether they ’ re republican or democrat have to get the money out to the people hopefully they ’ ll be able to do it but many of those state have computers i don ’ t know that they ’ re equip i want to give them money direct if that ’ s what you ’ re talk about i want to give the money out direct it would have be much easier but the democrats and some people say “ no let ’ s do it the complicate way ” i ’ m talk more about the stimulus check the — like — the president all right well i be talk about — — when will people get their money the president excuse me i be talk about both yeah when will people get that money the president yeah they ’ ll get it they will go ahead please thank you sir i ’ d like to ask question both for myself and some of the other reporters who aren ’ t in the room social distance the president sure first of all — and this be for yourself and dr birx what percentage of the population do we suspect to be asymptomatic at this point be there a way to figure that out it seem like the antibody test might be able to assist in determine that number the president go ahead deborah dr birx yeah thank you so while we ’ re work diligently in the midst of the crisis to make sure that the healthcare workers and everyone who be sick get provide for at the same time we ’ re work on test and assay that will be critical for surveillance and at the same time work on plan for what we need to do as this move through the population and we get on the downside where we ’ re sort of — we ’ re not there yet and hopefully most of the state will — say like california and washington and then what we need to do to be prepare for fall so all three of those things be happen simultaneously and there ’ s people work on each one of those work stream the antibody piece be critical as you describe because at this time we can ’ t — if we have — let ’ s say asymptomatic status be inversely — symptomatic status be inversely relate to age and so the younger you be the more likely you be to be asymptomatic we have to know that because we have to know how many people have actually become infect so when we talk about five days ago — i think on monday — i call on universities to work on an elisabased test to test for their health workers and really get through that at the same time the private sector be work on test and what do we want those test to be we want those test to be like what we use for hiv and malaria — finger prick onto a cassette you get a line if you ’ re positive and you get a control line negative the line isn ’ t there and there ’ s the control line that ’ s what — that ’ s our dream assay because it ’ s a finger prick in the meantime we ’ re not wait i mean we ’ re push for that at the same time we ’ re ask to develop an assay — the elisabased assay which require a tube of blood and that ’ s why we ’ re also talk about could we use dry blood spot we also put out a call directly out to the military because of the roosevelt to really test all of the sailors on the roosevelt with an antibody test to get to this critical issue of asymptomatic and already preexist antibody that would be — if the first responders know they already have have it and they have protective antibody if the nurse know the doctor know if your schoolteacher know then it ’ s a very different dialogue so we understand the importance of that and we understand how important it be in relationship to understand this epidemic one other comment because i know we ’ re always say “ who know what when i just want to make clear there ’ s countries work on this collectively together it ’ s devastate for every single country when we get through this we can go back and look at what happen where and what do this epidemic look like and when you get through it then you can validate every model there be know to man when you ’ re in the middle of it you have to concentrate on serve the need of each american and what that need look like at the same time you have these other work stream on surveillance and how to be prepare both scientifically and therapeutically and vaccinewise for the next fall if it happen again so i think these things be happen together but i just want us to really concentrate on the fact that all around the globe country after country be deal with this and we can talk about “ why didn ’ t italy do something or spain do something or germany do something or we can really say “ right now we all can we can do something we can do the social distance and all of the piece that we know be start to work around the globe in country after country and then when we get through all of this we can ask the question about “ could we have do some piece of this better as a global community ” i will remind you that on february the head of the who say there be no reason to ever do a travel ban you know it wasn ’ t until january that we know that there be humantohuman transmission remember — dr birx the president be say this be go to go away it ’ s april the president it be go to go away it be go away the president — but mr president you say it be go to go away in april the president it ’ s go — i didn ’ t say a date you say “ when it warm up in april… ” the president i say it ’ s go away and it be go away okay be you — dr birx — dr birx yes thank you sir but — if i ’ m — the president okay that be a good answer to your question no no no no no no more that be a long but a very good answer that be enough for you i have a question on the insurance inaudible coverage mr president on the insurance coverage for treatment the way your government be go be try to make sure that people be cover on the treatment for covid — the president yeah we ’ re go to do that do that include the million people who be in this country illegally be they go to be cover as well the president we ’ ll be talk about that at a different time yeah please go head yes mr president will you release — authorize the release of the underlie data for the conclusion of the to people succumb perhaps dr birx can talk — the president well that ’ s up to dr birx you ’ ll decide as to when — dr birx we can release all of the — i — some disease experts have express concern that they haven ’ t see the underlie data they ’ re not question — the president i ’ m sure they ’ ll talk to you about that and dr fauci too please go ahead thank you mr president this be for you and secretary azar ten million people say they ’ ve lose their job in the past two weeks so how be this stimulus money for free treatment go to absorb the new number of uninsured and — the president go ahead if you want — go ahead — would it not be easier to reopen the obamacare market or expand medicaid secretary azar so for an individual who have employer insurance — that ’ s what i mention in my remark — if you be employ and have insurance through your employer and you ’ ve now lose your job and lose that insurance you now do have a special enrollment period where you may enroll in the individual exchange of the affordable care act so that ’ s — that ’ s exist law then what we ’ re do be take from that hundred billion dollars to providers take money and say “ if you ’ re a provider and you care for anybody who be uninsured we ’ re go to compensate you for do that and we ’ re go to compensate you at the medicare reimbursement rat and you be not allow to bill that uninsured individual anything ” so in many respect it ’ s better for those uninsured individuals they ’ re go to get firstdollar coverage they ’ re go to get care in the unite state and the provider be go to be make whole from this program so it ’ s really an unprecedented — what president trump be do here with this money be an unprecedented diseasespecific support of care for individuals to make sure that people get treatment will someone still be bill if they test negative or what about noncovid condition so i just have a couple of question about supply — one specifically on new york and the question of ventilators governor cuomo be say that new york may be days away from run out of ventilators can you assure new york that go into next week that they ’ re go to have the ventilators that they ’ re go to need the president no they should ’ ve have more ventilators at the time they should have have more ventilators they be totally under service we be try to do — we ’ re do our best for new york you know we have — we have state we have a lot of state we have territories too but we have a lot of state that have to be take care of some much more so than others we ’ ve work very well with the governor we happen to think that he ’ s well serve with ventilators we ’ re go to find out but we have other state to take care of we have a big problem in louisiana we have a big problem in michigan we have a big problem in seven other really strong hotspots but we ’ re do the best we can i wish they do the original order three years ago they would ’ ve have all the ventilators they need although even then they wouldn ’ t because if you look at what the original request be from new york it be far greater than anybody ever hear and we ’ ve — we ’ ve supply a lot i tell you we supply some just today to new york and we supply some yesterday to new york city do you have one in the back yeah please mr president if i can say — this be why the question about the stockpile that be ask earlier be so important the president i don ’ t think that be the question inaudible no it be a very important question because what jar kushner say yesterday be that the federal stockpile be for use by the federal government not for the state to have access to so you seem to be say different so do jar kushner misspeak yesterday the president no no he didn ’ t — he didn ’ t misspeak be that federal stockpile available to the state the president he use the word “ our okay “ our ” — “ our ” be refer to our country yeah but he say — he say it ’ s not for the state to use the president the state to the best of my knowledge and to the best of your knowledge be a part of our country we be take what be in the federal stockpile and we be help state all over the country but we also want to keep some because when that surge come when you hit those peak we ’ re go to need it and we have to be able to have the flexibility to take those ventilators and bring them to louisiana new york detroit different place that ’ s all but you will be use them for the state that need them the president oh of course we ’ re not use them anywhere else we ’ re not go to be use them jon anywhere else but we want the flexibility because you know we don ’ t even know when the surge be come but it ’ s come soon and it ’ s go to be big and some areas win ’ t have it some areas will be pleasantly surprise just like we ’ ve be you look at the chart state that i think would have be maybe a disaster turn out to be — really they ’ ve do a great job some state be really trouble but you don ’ t know you don ’ t know we have great flexibility i would have prefer give them all out we ’ d have nothing and now when we have a surge we can ’ t get them back from where we give them because it ’ s very tough to take it back so we have tremendous flexibility and it could be new york it could be louisiana those be two that be really rough new jersey be very rough and they ’ ve do a very good job in new jersey but new jersey be very rough go ahead please in the back yes the question or — the question be about the cdc guidelines i know that they change over time from february and there be — the president the guidelines relative to which — the mask for instance social distance and the number of people who can gather in a group and so on and now we have this — this measure about wear mask and i know you tell steve about why you don ’ t want to wear a mask but i ’ m just wonder if you can tell us more about why because it would set — the president i ’ m just don ’ t choose to — an example the president they ’ re not mandatory guidelines they ’ re guidelines they suggest you could wear them you don ’ t have to wear them in fact the director be here if you want to say a couple of word about it you don ’ t — you can if you want you don ’ t have to but what i ’ m really inaudible your decision not to wear one the president but basically it ’ s — it ’ s a voluntary thing say it director he ’ s do a good job dr redfield thank you very much i think i just want to reemphasize — i ’ ve say this before — that we ’ re not defenseless against this virus we have a powerful tool a powerful weapon that be social distance and we ’ ve continue to embrace that with the president ’ s initiatives to slow the spread of coronavirus we ’ re constantly look at new data and as the surgeon general say one of the new information that become more clear to all of us be there ’ s a greater number of people that be asymptomatically infect than we previously think as ambassador birx say that may be inversely relate to age and so really the purpose here be first and foremost to embrace the social distance that ’ s the number one thing that ’ s the powerful weapon and you know this virus have a great weakness it can ’ t jump from one person to another if it ’ s get to swim more than six feet and this be why we really want that that say we now know that there may be individuals in signif — areas of significant community transmission that may be asymptomatically infect and we know that a face barrier can actually interrupt the number of virus particles that can go from one person to the other so as be say by the vice president this be — and the president — the purpose of this face cover be to be another adjunctive mitigation strategy to protect someone from spread the virus from themselves to someone else the president and i be just test also so i assume i don ’ t know have the virus so i don ’ t have to worry about spread it okay please go ahead mr president i want to make sure we ’ re clear when you mention tariff earlier — the president yeah — that come up in a meet be you consider tariff on saudi arabian oil and then also — the president well i can always consider — look tariff have make a tremendous amount of money for our country i put them on china i put them on other place and other countries tariff us and they take advantage of us and they have for many years look countries have take advantage of the unite state for years they ’ ve rip us off like nobody can even believe whether it be on — on manufacture whether it be on export whether it be on almost anything include military where we provide virtually free military assistance to countries that frankly take advantage of us don ’ t even like us okay so this have be go on for years they tariff us they create artificial — you could say nonfinancial barriers which be worse than financial barriers you can ’ t sell your product you can ’ t take care of our farmers they win ’ t take our — and yet they ’ ll take us and sell into us and we win ’ t charge them anything for do it look they ’ ve take advantage of us for years tariff be a way of even the score tariff be a way of just neutralize they have tariff on us and we now can put tariff on them be i use it for oil it ’ s something we can no — be i do it now no be i think about impose it as of this moment no but if we ’ re not treat fairly it ’ s certainly a tool in the toolbox and what about with russia be you — would you consider maybe lift sanction or give some sanction relief if they — the president well it would be the same thing no it would be the same thing they be have a dispute — the two countries — and it ’ s hurt the rest of the world because it ’ s really hurt the energy industry russia be be hurt unbelievably badly and saudi arabia be be hurt unbelievably badly because oil and gas be a primary — that ’ s where they get most of their income and this be a price like from the all right it ’ s a price from the they be be hurt very badly i think they ’ re go to settle their dispute pretty quickly why — on the oil why do you think you haven ’ t be more successful on get them to raise the price the president go ahead please why — why do you think you haven ’ t be more successful in get them to increase production in russia and saudi arabia if inaudible the president well they have increase production that ’ s what they ’ ve do they ’ ve increase it so much that there ’ s so — you mean the opposite the president i mean — yeah why do you think you haven ’ t be successful in inaudible increase production the president yeah look look just so — well they ’ re go to stop because the market ultimately the market be go to get them to stop but they both do the opposite they increase production to a level that water be right now more valuable than oil who would have ever think right you have relationships with — the president you go to — you go to some of these kingdoms water be far more valuable than oil there ’ s so much oil it ’ s a tribute in a way inaudible the president but what happen be there be a lot to start off with and then you have the virus and it knock the hell out of the market it — in term of demand so there ’ s no demand and there ’ s tremendous supply so i mean you saw number where it be down to and down frankly below it be even below it ’ s an incredible thing the market but ultimately the marketplace will take care of it but i think they ’ re go to work out their problem fairly quickly okay go ahead mr president — thank you mr president we ’ re already talk about phase four of a stimulus right but you and pelosi and mcconnell be already talk about different things that should be in it now last time people be tell me that the fact that you wouldn ’ t talk to pelosi be an impediment and it really slow things down be you — the president i ’ d talk — if it be important to talk to her i ’ d talk to her be you go to talk to her during the — the president if it be important for the american people i ’ d talk to her but other than that i can have other people talk to her look you ready infrastructure be a great thing for me i think infrastructure for this country — we have an old break infrastructure fifty years ago we be the envy of the world and then we spend all this money so stupidly in the middle east we spend — it ’ s go to be very close to trillion in the middle east how stupid be that decision but they spend it on that and other things we ’ ve get to fix our infrastructure but pelosi be already downplay — the president that mean roads highways tunnel airports everything we get to fix our infra — but pelosi be already kind of downplay — the president and the beauty be because of the fact that we be so strong as a country we ’ re borrow at zero we never have a chance to borrow at zero even in this country we ’ d never have a chance to borrow at zero we ’ re go borrow — this be a great time so we can fix our infrastructure and we ’ ll have almost no interest cost this be the time to do it steve one more question the death total projection that you share with us earlier this week be we still on the current trajectory for that or have social distance — the president which trajec — which one i have many trajectories for many things the — to to be we still on that trajectory or have we make any improvements or maybe not enough time have pass the president say — say it say it steve what have we make enough improvements the president on what on what on social distance have the model change have the model change the president i ’ d have to ask dr fauci and i ’ d have — have to ask deborah have the model change dr birx so a lot of the projections you can see be base on — there ’ s many different ways to look at this and as we discuss on sunday some of it be base on the current global experience we be about i think or time the size of italy a different factor in spain and we look at all of those — what their projections be where they be currently and where that be go and so a lot of the work be base on how this virus have move through other populations that ’ s a very direct way to see how the virus be impact a population there ’ s also terrific model and so every day and every night one of the model that actually look at the model relate to mortality be the healthdataorg data and they update it every night and you can see where we be in that projection i think in the last run of that model they be at or something in the model now all of that can be change by our behaviors and so — and all of it can be change in a different way if we don ’ t follow those behaviors if another major metropolitan area end up have an epidemic like the new york metro area that could dramatically change not the model but the reality of the impact of this virus on americans and where be the model on — the president and by the way the model show hundreds of thousands of people be go to die you know what i want to do i want to come away under the model the professionals do the model i be never involve in a model but — at least this kind of a model but you know what hundreds of thousands of people they say be go to die i want much less than that i want none but it ’ s too late for that but i want very few people relative to what the model be say those be projections i hope they ’ re wrong i hope we ’ re go to be under those projections mr president two question on continuity of government for — the president how come you always have two why can ’ t you have one well they ’ re relate the president every time “ i have three question i have two question can you give me one instead because we have a couple of other people go ahead okay i ’ ll go with my second one the governor of wisconsin be now talk about delay the primary at least not have inperson vote so my question be — and i ask this a couple weeks ago i want to see if you ’ ve make any progress on this look ahead to the fall be you take step to ensure that the general election will happen even if this pandemic have reemerged or hasn ’ t go away and — the president the general election will happen on november and do you — be you — the president in wisconsin what happen be i through social media — media put out a very strong endorsement of a republican conservative judge who ’ s an excellent brilliant judge he ’ s a justice and i hear what happen be his poll number go through the roof and because of that i think they delay the election you don ’ t think the governor be concern about people go to inperson vote the president i don ’ t know why didn ’ t he do it before he be do right before the election but do you think every — the president excuse me why didn ’ t he do this two weeks ago all of a sudden — but isn ’ t it — because of the pandemic the president excuse me all of a sudden an election which be take place very soon get delay now i just endorse him today and it be a very strong endorsement his poll — he ’ s go very high up and all of a sudden the governor come out — the democrat governor by the way — come out and say “ oh we ’ re go to move this election so i don ’ t know i ’ m sure — i hope you ’ re right i hope you ’ re right but — but do you think every state in this country should be prepare for mailin vote in case we ’ re in a situation — the president no because i think a lot of people cheat with mailin vote i think people should vote with id — voter id i think voter id be very important and the reason they don ’ t want voter id be because they intend to cheat when you get something when you buy something you look at your card and credit card and different card — you have your picture on many of them not all of them but on many of them you should have a picture on your — on your — for vote it should be call “ voter id they should have that and it shouldn ’ t be mailin — but how be you go to — the president excuse me it shouldn ’ t be mailin vote it should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself you don ’ t send it in the mail where people pick up — all sort of bad things can happen by the time they sign that if they sign that — if they sign that by the time it get in and be tabulate no it shouldn ’ t be mail in you should vote at the booth and you should have voter id because when you have voter id that ’ s the real deal thank you very much we ’ ll see you tomorrow en pm edt

great and thank you to all the bank but again in particular bank of america they really step right up and they do it there be no big deal they weren ’ t make a big deal out of anything so that be terrific and i think what we want to do — john cornyn please i know how you be so involve in this come from the great state of texas would you like to say a couple of word john senator cornyn thank you mr president thank you for convene the meet many of us have be talk together but we can ’ t get do what need to be do only you and the administration can and particularly get the attention of the saudis and flood the market really add insult to injury in a time when on our economy be suffer anyway because of the coronavirus and so this meet could not be more timely i agree with what ’ s be say about the importance of affordable energy to our standard of live and really we ’ ve change the — change the world as a result of the production of domestic energy here and improve the quality of life for a lot of people the president thank very much john really good job and john agree — we be talk about it the other day — that you ’ ve all do well but you ’ ve also keep energy very affordable really very very affordable and very — a lot of it we never have any problems and we ’ re go to keep it that way do i see dan back there dan senator sullivan yes sir mr president laughter the president i be look — i think that look like dan senator sullivan i want to thank you for convene this meet you know under the trump administration work with the congress the us have become the world ’ s energy superpower again it ’ s unbelievable and these company have do it obviously it ’ s a very important issue in my state the great state of alaska but these be great job as john cornyn just say for all of our state but it ’ s really important for the national security of our country too and we have be — a number of senators have be reach out have frank discussions with the saudis say “ hey if you ’ re a longstanding ally of ours we ’ re not — right now you ’ re hurt a lot of our citizens you ’ re hurt a lot of the people we represent and shouldn ’ t take us for grant ” we have a great military that ’ s protect saudi arabia for decades and senator cramer and i have some legislation that could possibly change that if they don ’ t start cooperate so again we appreciate your leadership with the crown prince with the russians in call this meet but this be a great sector of the us economy that once we get through this and we will — of this pandemic this –this sector be go to take off again and your — your administration and you have have a lot to do with the strength of the us energy sector and we need to keep it strong the president thank you very much dan and kevin cramer north dakota people don ’ t realize how big a producer north dakota be right senator cramer well harold know laughter senator cornyn harold know senator cramer it sort of allow the others inaudible the president harold — harold know that ’ s for sure senator cramer mr president to echo everything and maybe add a little bite the people around your cabinet table right now be part of the renaissance of oil and gas in this country but since you become president we go from a renaissance to security to independence to dominance and that dominance and that security be — right now be in some danger just a quick example in north dakota since saudi arabia and russia announce their little price war we ’ ve have billion of cutbacks take out of our state plan for this year the president yeah senator cramer i be economic development director when the entire gross domestic product of north dakota be billion so that ’ s significant that represent not just capex that represent lot of job lot of people in the value chain and i would just add one word to what dan talk about with regard to saudi arabia it be estimate by one report in that we spend a minimum of billion defend global oil supply we can use that money in national defense and other hotspots in the world if our friends be go to treat us this way so i appreciate your outreach this week i think we ’ re halfway there just with the success of your diplomacy this week thank you for this meet the president well it ’ s go up it ’ s go up and we have to otherwise we do — we lose a lot of job too we ’ re talk about one of the big job producers anywhere kevin right would you have anything to say mr sommers mr president thank you i ’ m mike sommers i ’ m president and ceo of the american petroleum institute the folks around this table represent the american energy revolution and we want to thank you for everything that you ’ ve do to support that revolution and we want to make sure that revolution continue — the president right mr sommers — after this pandemic crisis be solve the president thank you mike mr sommers thank you sir the president thank you very good leader mccarthy i think senator cruz be somewhere — the president i think he ’ s around here leader mccarthy right back there ted can ’ t be see the president where — where be senator cruz participant he ’ s hide behind the press laughter the president i can ’ t believe it he ’ s go — he ’ s go over to the evil side laughter that ’ s terrible cruz what be you do there senator cruz mr president thank you for convene this meet this be an important meet and this be the time as you know of crisis all across the country — a public health crisis and an economic crisis as you ’ ve hear and as you know from everyone around this table the energy sector have be a huge part of the economic success and boom that we ’ ve enjoy over the last several years and the combination of the economic harm of the coronavirus crisis combine with the saudis and russians wag economic warfare on job in this country it ’ s be a perfect storm in the energy sector and i ’ ll tell you there be a lot of job — there be millions of job in texas and across the country that be represent by the men and women around this table and by energy producers and there be small producers throughout texas and throughout the country who be — who be on the verge of be drive out of business and so this — this meet i think be important every one of the senators in this room have have multiple conversations with the saudis lean in hard on the saudis and your leadership and diplomacy with the crown prince have a big impact get them to stop flood the market and take advantage of this crisis and i would underscore one other issue that a number of the folks around this table have raise and i ’ m very concern about be ensure that those in energy in this time of crisis have access to capital that — there be job that be hang in the balance and if the energy producers in this country that have make america the number one producer of oil and gas in the world can ’ t access capital to get out of this crisis we ’ re go to see bankruptcies at a level this country hasn ’ t see in decades and so this meet and the continue leadership of your administration be hugely important thank you the president good thank you very much ted and while you ’ re up the concept and for instance — i think we should say it in front of the media — but oil reserve store oil we ’ re fill up the national reserve as you know we ’ re get the oil at a great price but at these price — in fact kevin and i have be speak about it john and i have be speak about it — at these price you would think you ’ d want to fill up every cavity that we have in this country and there ’ s some areas in louisiana and other areas that could be fill up they hold a lot of oil but at these price — and it would be good and it would keep everybody work — but you would think you ’ d want to fill up those areas what do you think of that ted senator cruz look i think that ’ s exactly right i think it make sense in term of ease the pressure that be threaten these job but it also make sense for the taxpayer the president yeah senator cruz that strategic petroleum reserve be there in time of crisis and usually the way the federal government work be we buy when it ’ s expensive and we sell when it ’ s cheap the president yeah no it ’ s — senator cruz we actually have an opportunity now to buy when it ’ s cheap i think it be inexcusable that democratic leadership in the house and senate block that in this bill we pass last week and then i think congress need to go back and address it leader mccarthy it be in the bill senator cruz yep leader mccarthy and then the speaker come in and that ’ s the one thing — when she hold this bill up for the number of days — that she remove the president twentydollar oil think of it leader mccarthy yeah the president twenty dollars senator cruz well and there be too many democrats — the president it ’ s politics senator cruz — that want to see these — the president it ’ s all right senator cruz — job go away the president i think you should go back though kevin i think you should go back and see john if you guy can go back and do a separate bill and beyond that you know i think it ’ s million barrel right now to fill it up that ’ s not that much so it ’ s fairly in pretty good shape but we have other areas that be bigger frankly that we can fill up too but at those price we should be — we should be pump it out so maybe you guy can check on it and see what you can do about it i don ’ t think anyone can reject it nobody can reject it ted you ’ ll work on that senator cruz absolutely the president anybody else david you guy okay david you want to say something secretary bernhardt so just one thing mr president the department of the interior manage a large portion of land and part of the offshore and one of the things we have do over the last days as you have the “ slow the spread ” we have really have our inspectors out on the frontlines work to make sure that the production that ’ s take place be occur in a safe and a responsible manner and i thank everybody for their cooperation in that these job be so important to the american people and it ’ s important that we make sure that we dot our i ’ s and cross our t ’ s

brouillette mr president thank you thank you sir for your leadership the president thank you dan secretary brouillette my name be dan brouillette i serve the president as the secretary of energy with regard to the storage mr president i ’ m happy to announce we go to market this week for million barrel notwithstanding the — the desire of the congress not to give us new money to pursue this idea we have find an alternative finance mechanism — the president good secretary brouillette — so that we can immediately find — the president i figure you would laughter i actually wasn ’ t worry about it laughter secretary brouillette — so that can we can find — the president what be you pay per barrel secretary brouillette i ’ m sorry sir the president what be you pay laugh he didn ’ t want to answer secretary brouillette it ’ s go to be a little a low laughter the president what be you pay per barrel a flexible price or would it – secretary brouillette they may be pay us this could be a little

send a letter to its business clients today say that they don ’ t have the necessary guidance from the sba from the treasury department to be able to accept loan applications start tomorrow the need be clearly enormous but at least one major bank say they ’ re not fully empower yet to be able to help their customers secretary mnuchin well as i speak to all the ceos yesterday — i have a conference call with them — we get very good input from them on what they need as i say people be work until o ’ clock i believe we just put up the federal register with the new guidelines for lenders i ’ ve be assure that the bank will be in the process start tomorrow now again it ’ s go to take a little bite of time but we commit that this will be available tomorrow and i encourage all company go to sbacom sbagov go to treasurygov you can see the information you need immediately just to follow up with the smallbusiness owners a number of them be say that they be on that conference call and that there ’ s a tremendous power struggle go on between the treasury and sba and that it ’ s over process and form be what they tell me that lenders be actually opt out because they can ’ t make enough money to even service the loan so how be you go to make sure these smallbusiness owners get the capital they need to survive right now secretary mnuchin well first of all i can assure you — jovita be here jovita use to work for me as the treasurer there be no power struggle administrator carranza no secretary mnuchin jovita and our team as i say work together until o ’ clock in the morning and start work at o ’ clock again we ’ ve make the form simpler and i can assure you at five point — i ’ ve tell these bankers they should take all their traders and put them in the branch there ’ ll never be another opportunity to earn five point on a government — fully governmentguaranteed loan and those check right into direct deposit the irs now say it would take four to five months you ’ re say two weeks can you give us a solid — secretary mnuchin well let me be — let me be clear i don ’ t know where you ’ re hear these things i tell you this would be three weeks i ’ m not commit to two weeks we ’ re deliver on our commitments the irs which i oversee within two weeks the first money will be in people ’ s account just to follow up on that i think the question be not about the first check for folks who have direct deposit it sound like those will go out pretty quickly the question be then for folks who don ’ t have direct deposit secretary mnuchin sure and there be a staff memo that be release by the house ways and mean committee today say that that process could take up to five weeks sic that take you to midaugust be that how long it ’ s go to take secretary mnuchin that be not go to take five — or five months i ’ m sorry secretary mnuchin again let me just say when obama send out these check it take months and months and months i be assure the american public they need the money now what we ’ re go to do be — again if we have your information you ’ ll get it in two — in — within two weeks social security you ’ ll get it very quickly after that if we don ’ t have your information you ’ ll have a simple web portal you ’ ll upload it if we don ’ t have that we ’ ll send you check in the mail how many check can you process in a week though how many check can you — secretary mnuchin again we can process a lot of check but we don ’ t want to send check in this environment we don ’ t want people to get check we want to put money directly into their account thank you mr secretary this be for i guess both you and the administrator there have be some anecdotal report that business people be try to get access to the online site to submit the applications the website have be crash i ’ ve hear of webinars go offline because there ’ s just too many people on them so how be you guy go to be ready you know tomorrow to get these loan out secretary mnuchin we ’ ve bring in a lot of external resources at sba and us to make sure there ’ s additional capacity as i say we hear a lot of good feedback yesterday to simplify this process it ’ s go to be up and run now let me just be clear that doesn ’ t mean everybody be go to get their loan tomorrow but the system will be up and run we encourage people over the next week sign up you can go on right now you can go on the web see what information you need very simple process mr secretary on a separate subject have you be in touch with leader mcconnell and speaker pelosi about their differences right now about another stimulus package secretary mnuchin i speak to — i ’ ve speak to the leader i ’ ve speak to the speaker i ’ ve speak to the president constantly when the president be ready and think we should do the next stage we ’ re ready the president have talk about the issue of infrastructure since the campaign i think you know that ’ s a big priority for him and again if we run out of money on the smallbusiness program we ’ ll be back right away to congress to get this increase do the unemployment number today increase the urgency of do a phase four secretary mnuchin well let me just say you know we ’ re go through something that we ’ ve never do before where the government have shut down big part of the economy because of health reason our economy be in great shape our company be in great shape there be three ways that americans be go to be protect for small business they ’ ll get pay by their business through this program the direct deposit there ’ s also enhance unemployment so we realize unfortunately there be a lot of company that because they aren ’ t in business over a short period of time — again we ’ re work with the state on enhance unemployment and as soon as the medical professionals and the president give the all clear we ’ re go to have a ton of liquidity we have about trillion — this have never be do between us and the feed — to put into the economy to support american workers and american business mr secretary in addition to the jobless number we saw today phase three be sign before the social distance guidelines be extend for another month so what additional relief be you go to give to americans as they stay out of work for all these extra weeks i mean what be you wait for secretary mnuchin well we — in design this program we think that we have liquidity for about weeks and that ’ s what we ’ ve design and again i think the president ’ s be very clear if we need to go back to congress to support the american economy and american workers we will be do that secretary mnuchin house speaker nancy pelosi have form a select committee to oversee the distribution of recovery fund and she say she want to make sure that those fund be wisely and efficiently spend do you think that select committee be something that ’ s necessary secretary mnuchin i don ’ t i mean you know the — both party want us to have oversight want us to have transparency we have full transparency we have a oversight committee that the speaker get to pick someone the leader get to pick someone i believe there ’ s five people on it and again that committee will review the money that we ’ re spend and again we support full transparency taxpayers should understand how we ’ re go to support this economy and job mr secretary senator murkowski have ask you to consider provide loan to energy company under the care act the phase three bill what be your thoughts on that would you consider provide those loan to energy company secretary mnuchin so thank you and let me clarify i have very limit ability to do direct loan out of the treasury i can do them for passenger airlines cargo airlines contractors and national security company outside of that we work with the federal reserve to create broadbased lend facilities which we will do so so our expectation be the energy company like all our other company will be able to participate in broadbased facilities whether it ’ s the corporate facility or whether it ’ s the “ main street ” facility but not direct lend out of the treasury a question for clarity about the direct payments to americans for those folks who don ’ t have bank account who don ’ t have direct deposit information on file with the irs how long would they have to wait for their check secretary mnuchin well for people who don ’ t have direct deposit — again we ’ ll have an easy way they put it up we can on a roll basis — i think you know within a couple of days when they give it to us we ’ ll send the money out we do realize there be people who be underbanked and again we ’ re work with all the digital company prepay debit card we ’ re work with all of them to make sure we have a process that every american get their money quickly this money do people no good if it show up in four months and we will deliver on that promise so “ quickly ” be a matter of weeks then perhaps not months secretary mnuchin “ quickly ” be a matter of weeks and not months that ’ s correct mr secretary would you consider a moratorium — secretary mnuchin in the back go ahead mr secretary one area where you can make direct loan be to the airlines how much do you expect that the treasury department and the federal government will be involve in oversee the operations of airlines as it pertain to which rout get cut back how much they operate what they do about their employees and the like secretary mnuchin so there be — there be very strict requirements that ’ s build into the bill again this be a bipartisan requirement one anything we do with the airlines they have to maintain substantially all of their employees so again any money that we provide them will go to pay their employees we ’ re go to be work with the secretary of transportation there be requirements to maintain certain rout so again we have a very clear process we ’ ve hire three outside advisors who will be financial advisors and three law firm we ’ ll be release that information shortly and i want to thank them they ’ re all work for basically very very little money they couldn ’ t work for free so they ’ ve agree to basically work for what they would sign up to work for charitable organizations so again no big fee to bankers we ’ ve get a great team of three lawyers and three financial advisors that will assist us mr secretary just to follow up on that will you give us a list of the name of those people who be advise you when you release the information secretary mnuchin of course we will we ’ ll give you the name as well as the contract so again — do you have any name right now other than blackrock secretary mnuchin so again i ’ m happy to announce we have — the pjt partner — okay — be go to do the passenger airlines moelis company be go to do the cargo and contractors and perella weinberg will handle the national security and there ’ ll be three law firm which we ’ ll announce shortly that will be work in each one of those sectors and again let me just be clear we need to get this do quickly the airlines need money we ’ re go to work very closely with the department of transportation and get this do quickly we ’ ve actually already receive contract from a lot of the people again there ’ s guidance up on the web full transparency we ’ ve ask for applications mr secretary on the airline issue again you know speaker pelosi and others have say that the government take stake in those airlines should not be a condition for the federal government to provide payroll support specifically what ’ s your response to that secretary mnuchin i speak to the speaker last night about that this be something that be highly negotiate between the republicans and the democrats the president be personally involve in this he be on the phone with us many time mitch mcconnell mark meadows senators on both side there be a specific line in the bill that say that the secretary mean me will determine proper compensation so this be not a bailout for the airlines and i will be work — once we get our advice from our financial advisors we get the applications from the airlines i ’ ll be work very closely with the president and we ’ ll make sure that we strike the right balance not a bailout taxpayers get compensate but these airlines — these be national security issue we want to keep our airlines intact mr secretary just more broadly for — perhaps for the administrator if not for you as well some small businesses restaurant owners for example be find that lay off their employees so that they can start collect unemployment be better both for them as business owners and for their workers what incentives do they have right now to keep their employees on the payroll if no one be come into their restaurant secretary mnuchin well the incentive that you have — and we want american business to be keep intact the incentive be these be loan that turn into grant so if you ’ re a business owner and you ’ re a restaurant you can hire your people back you get money for their medical you keep them on the medical plan you get money for your rent you get money for your electricity so you ’ re motivate we want you to have a business that you can reopen quickly when it ’ s appropriate so this doesn ’ t cost the business owners anything you know when people talk about — i can ’ t imagine any american worker who have a job have offer to keep their job isn ’ t go to want to have it and let me just be clear — we ’ ve also talk about this unemployment issue you can only get unemployment if you don ’ t have a job so unemployment be intend for those people that be some of the midsize or larger businesses — and we ’ re very sympathetic to this — that these company can ’ t afford and for those people the enhance unemployment will be a significant benefit but we want to make sure — percent of the american workforce be small businesses under people the president the vice president the administrator and i want to make sure this part of the economy be ready and intact when we ’ re ready to reopen a question for the administrator if i may be there a certain category of small businesses that you ’ re most concern about restaurants hair salons things like that administrator carranza that ’ s a great question we ’ re concern about every small business there ’ s million small businesses that we ’ re really focus on and we ’ re work feverishly to make sure that we can provide the available fund to them as quickly as possible so it ’ s million small businesses and the other businesses be be deal with with the ppp with the paycheck protection there be also the disaster — what we call it the injury — or economic injury disaster loan and then there be an advance associate with that particular program as well so to answer your question we ’ re concern about all businesses and as the secretary indicate we ’ re look at employees be ready not lose in this process we want businesses to stay intact because they represent half the — half the gdp so if we spend a trillion to support trillion or trillion i think that ’ s a significant investment and that ’ s what we ’ re focus on be there a certain segment that ’ s particularly vulnerable secretary mnuchin let me — i just want to — hang on i just want to make one comment for explanation because i want to make sure everybody out there understand this if you ’ re an independent contractor if you ’ re a sole proprietor you ’ re eligible for this as well now that program win ’ t be up and run until next week but again this be a very broad definition of small business so if you ’ re an independent plumber if you ’ re an independent contractor you ’ re cover under this program it ’ s slightly more complicate you have to come in to your bank and give them more information but start next week that part of the program will be up and run also charities charities as well very important the vice president and president make sure that we cover small charities in this and do that include church and religious nonprofits secretary mnuchin it do although there be some technical issue but yes it do include faith organizations be that under the under the — that ’ s under the sba program secretary mnuchin this be under the ppp yes the new sba program they be cover the president okay thank you all very much secretary mnuchin okay thank you everybody the president thank you jovita thank you steve great job thank you okay so that begin right away and they start hand out check and a lot of people be go to have their businesses build back up quickly i hope and we ’ ll see it ’ s complicate big small business be actually big business so i thank them both and please — good we have some great gentlemen let me see great gentlemen that ’ s correct thank you very much today my administration be also issue new guidelines to protect elderly americans who remain the most vulnerable by now nurse home should have suspend the entry of all medically unnecessary personnel today we ’ re further recommend that all nurse home facilities assign the same staff to care for the same group of residents consistently to minimize any potential spread and we ’ re also urge facilities to designate separate areas for healthy and sick residents and this be a practice that we probably will be recommend into the future long after the enemy be go — this particular enemy be go we ’ re also make every effort to provide relief to our great veterans we take very good care of our veterans at my direction secretary wilkie will use any authority at his disposal to extend deadlines for benefit and to postpone debt collections we ’ re now conduct well over coronavirus test per day it ’ s over a thou — a hundred thousand test a day –and these be accurate test and they ’ re move rapidly — which be more than any other country in the world both in term of the raw number and also on a per capita basis the most the fda have also authorize the first coronavirus antibody test develop by cellex a key step that will help identify people who have recover and to understand their immune response and their immune system moments ago i direct secretary azar and act secretary wolf to use any and all available authority under the defense production act to ensure that domestic manufacturers have the supply they need to produce ventilators for patients with severe case of covid you know what that be right become a very famous term covid — covid this action will help general electric hillrom medtronic resmed royal philips and vyaire medical overcome obstacles in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilators we have over be build right now or soon to be start we anticipate issue more order under the defense production act in the very near future in addition to the one that i ’ ve just sign against for facemasks — we just sign an element of the act against and hopefully they ’ ll be able to do what they be suppose to do i just speak to mary barra of general motor and she say they ’ re very soon go to be ready to start production of the ventilators they have a lot of ventilators that they ’ ve commit to build and they ’ ll be start very very quickly fema continue to deliver resources to areas most affect by the virus include new york on top of the bed we ’ re already provide to the javits center the department of defense be add another icu bed governor cuomo have ask that this facility go — and it ’ s a big beautiful facility — it be convert to a covid hospital and we hadn ’ t do that yet we hadn ’ t think in term of do that but their use be — their real demand be for that and we have meet on it with the task force we have meet with the military and i ’ ve decide to say “ yes i ’ m go to do that ” that i will be sign and agree to a “ yes ” answer so that — we will be do that and also we will be staff it so the federal government be do a lot of things that wasn ’ t anticipate that it do this be a — andor can easily be set up — hospital build in javits center and so we ’ re go to be convert that to a hospital and it ’ s go to be staff by the military and by the federal government and base on the fact that i agree to that we have two other facilities that be likewise ask for it and that would be in louisiana and also in dallas and we ’ ll be do those we speak to the governor of louisiana speak to the governor of texas and we ’ ve tell them that we will be staff those hospitals again above and beyond but that ’ s okay we have to do that in addition the usns comfort be dock in new york to accept patients that be a noncovid to date fema have deliver more than million mask respirators and it ’ s — think of that million four million don ’ t forget we ’ re a secondary source the state be do it and we ’ re back them up but we ’ ve get million respirators million surgical mask face shield million gloves and ventilators just to the city and to the state of new york and some of them now be be send i speak with both governor cuomo and mayor de blasio a little while ago and some of them be be send to the city all of america stand with the people of new york in this time of need it ’ s definitely a hotspot but we have other hotspots also and we ’ re take them — take care of them very very strongly very powerfully we have the finest people in the world in those locations and i think the federal government have not only act early but act quickly professionally there ’ s no people like this doctor nurse first responders and other healthcare providers who want to help new york at this critical time should visit website nycgovhelpnow nycgovhelpnow they need help now they need people to help them we have great facilities and we ’ ve build some brandnew facilities big ones but we need help we need help for professional people so if you ’ re in an area that isn ’ t so affect and you ’ re a doctor a nurse a healthcare worker please get to that website and we would really appreciate your help new york city need it louisiana by the way need it michigan need it whatever you can do those be very strong hotspots they need help in recent weeks as the virus have spread and economic hardship have follow we have see americans unite with incredible selflessness and compassion i want to remind everyone here in our nation ’ s capital especially in congress that this be not the time for politics endless partisan investigations here we go again have already do extraordinary damage to our country in recent years you see what happen it ’ s witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt and in the end the people do the witch hunt have be lose and they ’ ve be lose by a lot and it ’ s not any time for witch hunt it ’ s time to get this enemy defeat conduct these partisan investigations in the middle of a pandemic be a really big waste of vital resources time attention and we want to fight for american live not waste time and build up my poll number because that ’ s all they ’ re do because everyone know it ’ s ridiculous so we want to focus on the people of this country even the people of the world — we ’ re go to be able to help them — because right now as an example we ’ re build so many ventilators — very very hard to build — but we ’ re build thousands thousands of them and a lot of them will be come at a time when we win ’ t need them as badly because it take time very complex very expensive and we ’ ll be able to help outside of our country we think we ’ ll be able to help that ’ s something that you can not easily produce as citizens we ’ re link together by the share bond of national love loyalty and affection there ’ s no earthly force more powerful than the patriotic pride that stir in our hearts and that be so true it ’ s incredible the job that everybody have be do everybody they don ’ t sleep they don ’ t go to bed sometimes they get nothing i say to somebody recently on the task force “ how many hours ’ sleep have you get over the last couple of days the answer be “ none none in one massachusetts neighborhood citizens come out of their home each night at o ’ clock from their porches and they sing “ god bless america others have join in spread from house to house down one street up to the next until their little town with a spirit of patriotism and remind all americans that we ’ re

we anticipate in the new york area that your local healthcare provider will make the decision whether you be transfer to the javits center and in all case simply look to the guidance of your local governors about how best to receive the care that every american — every american be entitle to have beyond that let me say that we have be work through fema ’ s acquisition process not only to deploy but to gather up personal protective equipment and in just a few moments you will hear from admiral john polowczyk about the extraordinary progress that we have make in deploy not just the strategic national stockpile but also in identify on the commercial marketplace around america and around the world literally millions of mask surgical gown gloves protective equipment and at this point we ’ ve distribute some ventilators and you ’ ll hear today specifically about the state that have receive those ventilators we ’ re just — this team have truly act in an inspire way and literally be work with dozens and dozens of people at the fema stabilization task force to make sure that we be leave no stone unturned to find the supply we need let me also say today you ’ re go to hear from jar kushner senior advisor to the president of the unite state but someone that the white house coronavirus task force direct to work with fema on supply chain issue and in recent weeks he ’ s be lead a work group in conjunction with fema that literally have identify millions of medical supply around the nation and around the world and we ’ re grateful for his efforts and his leadership finally you ’

patient have the treatment that they deserve every healthcare provider every doctor and nurse and nurse ’ s assistant have the protective gear to provide the care that you would want your family to

protect the health of your family to protect the health of your community we know so many people be asymptomatic and people that literally don ’ t know they have the coronavirus but have the ability to infect others we want you to put these guidelines into practice social distance use a drivethrough at a restaurant wash your hand on a regular basis but as we focus today on supply make no mistake about it every american can make sure that our healthcare workers and more importantly americans that be struggle with coronavirus have the equipment to support their treatment by put these principles into practice because the fewer americans that contract the coronavirus the fewer americans will have to enter our healthcare system and that ’ ll continue to preserve the capacity in our healthcare economy so we thank the millions of americans who have respond in the first two days of “ days to slow the spread and i ’ m just absolutely confident that in the days ahead every american be go to do their part — for your health your family ’ s health the health of your community — and to ensure the strength and vitality of the greatest healthcare system in the world with that let me introduce jar kushner to speak about the work that he ’ s be do work with fema on ensure a strong supply chain to meet this moment jar mr kushner thank you mr vice president and thank you for your great leadership on the task force and thank you to dr birx and dr fauci as well it ’ s be an honor work with you these past few weeks when the vice president first ask me to help on the task force with different task i ask the president what he expect from the task force and how i can best serve him and the task force what the president ask be that all of the recommendations that we make be base on data he want us to be very rigorous to make sure that we be study the data collect data a lot of things in this country be happen very quickly and we want to make sure that we be try to keep update our model and make sure that we be make inform decisions and inform recommendations to him base on the data that we be able to collect and put together the president want to make sure that we have the people do the best job and make sure that we have the right people focus on all the things that need to happen to make sure that we can deliver in these unusual time for the american people the president also instruct me to make sure that i break down every barrier need to make sure that the team can succeed this be an effort where the government be do things that the government doesn ’ t normally do where we be stretch we ’ re act very quickly and the president want to make sure that the white house be fully behind the different people run the different line of effort to make sure that we get everything do in a speed that the president demand the president also want us to make sure we think outside the box make sure we ’ re find all the best thinkers in the country make sure we ’ re get all the best ideas and that we ’ re do everything possible to make sure that we can keep americans safe and make sure we bring a quick end to this in the best way possible and balance all the different aspects that need to be think of while we do this this truly be a historic challenge we have not see something like this in a very very long time but i be very confident that by bring innovative solutions to these hard problems we will make progress today we be brief the president earlier he ask me to come out and talk a little bite about what we ’ ve do on the supply chain task force which admiral polowczyk have be lead and what he ’ s be very impress by be the way that we ’ ve be resourceful to find product all over the world all over the country and we be find ways to solve the different problems the president have be very very hand on in this he ’ s really instruct us to leave no stone unturned just this morning — very early this morning — i get a call from the president he tell me he be hear from friends of his in new york that the new york public hospital system be run low on critical supply he instruct me this morning i call dr katz who run the system ask him which supply be the most supply he be nervous about he tell me it be the mask i ask what his daily burn be and i basically get that number call up admiral polowczyk make sure we have the inventory we go to the president today and earlier today the president call mayor de blasio to inform him that we be go to send a month of supply to the new york public hospital system to make sure that the workers on the frontline can rest assure that they have the mask that they need to get through the next month we ’ ll be do similar things with all the different public hospitals that be in the hotspot zone and make sure that we ’ re constantly in communications with the local communities one thing i will say just base on data be that we ’ ve be get a lot of data from different governors and from different mayors and from different cities one thing i ’ ve see fema do very very well over the last week or so be now we ’ re get realtime data from a lot of cities people who have request for different products and supply a lot of them be do it base on projections which be not the realistic projections the projections change every day as we see the case as we see the impact of the “ stop the spread ” effort that this task force recommend and the president have be push forward so i do think that we ’ ll see that hopefully there ’ ll be impact of that and the task force have be work very hard through the fema group with admiral polowczyk to make sure that we ’ re get the supply to people before they run out and make sure that we ’ re do it in a proper way i ’ d like to just introduce admiral polowczyk who before come to this — i guess still be — he ’ s the vice director for logistics for the joint staff i get a call from one of the senators say “ well why don ’ t you put a great military person in charge of the logistics and the supply chain and the defense production act and i say “ well the president already do that this be the best man that we have in the country for supply and logistics he join the task force days ago over at fema and he ’ s build a team — really at the direction of the vice president — that include people from fema omb the fda hhs the white house and from everywhere else and what they ’ ve don over the last days have be really extraordinary we ’ ve do things that the government have never do before quicker than they ’ ve ever do it before and what we ’ re see now be we find a lot of supply in the country we ’ ve be distribute them where we anticipate there will be need and also try to make sure that we ’ re hit place where there be need so i can tell you the people on the — in the task force they ’ re work day and night you ’ ve get a lot of people in the government we recognize the challenge that america face right now we know what a lot of the people on the frontlines be face the fear that they have that they win ’ t have the supply they need and our goal be to work as hard as we can to make sure that we don ’ t let them down so i just want to thank everybody and with that i want to introduce admiral polowczyk who ’ s do an amaze job rear admiral polowczyk thank you mr kushner mr vice president so today i ’ m go to cover a couple items — a couple of — five things the first thing i ’ m go to talk about be resources push out from the federal government and then i ’ m go to talk about this air bridge which you may have hear about i ’ m go to talk about data as you say we ’ re — mr kushner be absolutely right we ’ re try to be data drive and with that i ’ m go to talk a little bite about how we ’ re try to expand the industrial base here to meet this challenge so the first thing i want to talk about be surgical mask so we ’ ve all — we ’ ve quickly state number here so these — i ’ m about to go through several different slide to give you just scale and magnitude of federal resources that have be apply at the problem so million surgical mask push out to state governments for mask million mask and so if i be — if i be in a local hospital that be run short i would — i would look upward because the federal government have push out resources so for protective gloves million million pair of protective gloves for face shield million face shield for ventilators we have push to the state more than ventilators and i think as i be come over here that number have change slightly i think it ’ s now give to these state — to the predominantly of these state so we want you to have some number now as we ’ ve indicate we have ventilators in the national stockpile we push ventilators out we ’ re hold ventilators to put to the point of need but we ’ re also buy ventilators ask the industrial base who produce approximately — prior to covid approximately ventilators a year we be go to over the next several months by the end of june work to acquire and so one of the — one of the tool that we ’ re go to — i can anticipate need — we ’ ve already execute — be all of those vendors that we ’ re buy them from will need — potentially will need help in their supply chain with their suppliers we might rate order we might help them get ahead of others in that endeavor so i think mr navarro be go to talk a little bite more on that later so let me talk about the air bridge so it normally take approximately days to get from overseas the product — load it get it to the unite state and distribute it that ’ s about days so to prime the pump so to speak we have line on an air bridge to get product here faster work with our major suppliers as they have — as they work to fill order to get more to healthcare workers now we be work to align transportation to product now one of the things we ’ re also do be the team that work for me be scour the globe and find pocket of personal protective equipment that might not otherwise be in the us hospital supply chain that be also go on these flight six complete and a number schedule twentyeight flight schedule here in the near future we ’ re — we be work towards — some days we ’ ll have one flight some days there might be two flight multiple flight over the next come days these or — as far as i can see out to a couple of weeks then again match product to flight to create volume in the supply chain here faster than the days i ’ m just go to leave that up as i talk about a few other items so let ’ s talk about new york city and the public health hospitals i believe they ’ re call new york city health and hospitals the president direct — as i speak there be pallets be form truck be load i give an address in new york city here an hour or two ago and one of our distributors be make that happen and that delivery will happen tomorrow on the data front this be almost unprecedented this be a commercial supply chain with six to seven major distributors of health equipment we bring them all in and we say we need to make inform decisions and we be go to help make inform allocation decisions so within a matter of days feed from their business systems — their enterprise resourcelike systems — i bring onboard a tool — a supply chain tower — that the dod be use to manage a supply chain for a very complex weapon system their data go into a data lake we have a tool to be able to use their data and see it i can tell what product be come in what their order be what they ’ re fill what they ’ re not fill and see the volume in the supply chain and understand what they ’ re do down to the county level we ’ re work to get it potentially down to the hospital level so this respirators we take a look in there in the supply chain and we say we can ’ t — we have the volume to go do that i call the distributor and they ’ re make — they ’ re make that happen we anticipate as the hotspots around the country — we anticipate these vendors at our direction help them allocate product to the right place at the right time so if i can talk finally about expand the industrial base so the vice president be at walmart the other day who tell him “ i want to get in this game how do i do that so i get the call we provide them specifications and now walmart be go to have — use their suppliers to cut fabric make gown sew product but that ’ s not always the case we have lot of folks that want to help i believe you will see in the come days the use of the defense production act in creative ways to help people that be not do this today to do it we have essentially lead — well the number yesterday be — i believe it probably grow today — that we be work with to find how each one of those might need help to get in the game that ’ s not in the game to increase the throughput through the healthcare market again the president give me one task get more to our healthcare workers now and i take that to heart because i have — not that i don ’ t need that from the president that direction to move out — but i have family in new york my sister be a nurse practitioner in a westchester hospital and my niece be a nurse on a long island hospital and i have other healthcare professionals in the family so i have skin in this game the president ask me to get more to the healthcare workers i ’ m go to get more to healthcare workers i ’ d like to hand it over to mr navarro the vice president inaudible the go out tomorrow — rear admiral polowczyk the be go out as we speak the vice president you might want to be very specific about that rear admiral polowczyk it ’ ll be — it ’ ll be deliver tomorrow can i ask a question the vice president let me — let me be clear on that if i can what jar announce what the admiral just unpack be that pallets be be load right now to send mask — rear admiral polowczyk respirators the vice president — to new york city to the public health hospitals rear admiral polowcyzk to the public health warehouse in new york city the vice president to all the healthcare workers help be on the way base on the tool and the data you have available to you where be the logjam where have it be how have you identify that rear admiral polowcyzk i think — because as you say all this — when we have millions more ppes go out the door as you well know the frontline medical workers be not get it rear admiral polowcyzk so i would answer you — i would answer you this way we put up a lot of number i say that if you ’ re not a — you ’ re in a hospital and you ’ re not see ppe i would look up to the state level first but we aren ’ t — we ’ ve hear from governors sir say they can ’ t get the medical equipment that they need and the reason for that be because accord to governors and also by the fact that we haven ’ t see any number up there about what be go to the private sector can you tell us what percentage of the supply on these large cargo plan be go to private company versus fema versus the state be it percent rear admiral polowcyzk so fema be — so this product that we ’ re move be primarily commercial product that would enter the commercial system and be distribute through financial business transactions between hospitals and these distributors so just to clarify that that explain why state say they ’ re bid like they ’ re on ebay because the supply be go to the private sector and then they have to go there to get the supply rear admiral polowcyzk that ’ s normally how things –that ’ s normally how things work right so i ’ m not here to disrupt a supply chain and say — look these six distributors — six seven — they have six to seven hundred warehouse they have truck to go to the hospital door every day we ’ re bring product in they ’ re fill order for hospitals nurse home like normal i ’ m put volume into that system i would say that we have the data now at last — so we put together this data element over the last you know what thirteen days get the people in look at the problem build this i be now see truth about what ’ s in the supply chain and i would say that there ’ s be some abnormal behavior okay yes thank you admiral house oversight committee democrats say that fema officials tell them that the ventilators that the government have order win ’ t be ready until june which be well after the expect peak will the defense production act memo sign today do anything to speed that up rear admiral polowczyk yes it will mr navarro will talk about that we ’ re on line to receive several thousand ventilators in the month of april and several thousand more ventilators in the month of may ramp up to a big number in june again go from you know an industry that produce about annum — annum to a — to a very big number admiral be you confident that this system mean the state with the greatest need be get the supply rear admiral polowczyk yeah so — because a lot of governors be say that they can ’ t get what they need and different state have more press urgency obviously depend on the caseload rear admiral polowczyk so we marry up — we ’ re marry up where cdc — where the demand for covid be to what ’ s in the commercial system we ’ re provide that to these — to the commercial system and we be make allocations to those of most press need thirteen days — we now have the data we now can make inform decisions and so all of the “ i need i need i need ” i now know the volume that have be happen and need to be happen so admiral with that — and mr president i ’ d love for you to weigh on — the president sure — weigh in on this as well you talk about — well you allude to the fact there be possibly some shady business go on that the product be here in the unite state and — rear admiral polowczyk and come here yes and it be come here it ’ s come from china it ’ s in warehouse it ’ s be make here in the unite state it ’ s in warehouse but it ’ s go to the highest bidder so what can be do to keep those products here in the unite state not go overseas where company be make a lot of money and — rear admiral polowczyk yeah i ’ m go to let mr navarro talk about that — and get it distribute to the most critical place here in the us the president yeah sure peter go ahead i would love to hear — how be that be do because doctor — i ’ ve talk to surgeons — mr navrrro that ’ s great great — great question — on a regular basis mr navrrro let me — let me give you the — the bigger view of the dpa and we ’ ll directly address that what we have essentially be a nation at war we have a wartime president stand behind me the defense production act be one of the most powerful weapons this administration can use to fight the invisible enemy of the virus when i speak with you last week i explain the three point of the compass dpa can be use to hit the first one be mobilization of the industrial base this can involve things like repurposing from say a distiller like pernod ricard — from liquor to hand sanitizer it can also involve expansion of production which be have honeywell — which make mask — open a new factory in smithfield rhode island with respect to the second point in the compass — allocation of resources — we have two issue there if you look at the manufacturer itself what you want to make sure be that the supply chain which can go seventiers deep have enough components in that supply chain so we can actually make what we need and then once it ’ s make you also want to make sure that it go to the right — right people and then the third point of the compass which — which address what you ’ re talk about be basically — “ bust ‘ em ” i call it — hoard of critical or threaten material so let me walk through what — what the president do today in term of a strong action and what we ’ ve do with the dpa across those three point the first order that president trump sign be vigorous swift it be the gm order which direct gm to make ventilators in kokomo indiana in trump time — which be to say “ as fast as possible ” as the president mention he ’ d speak to mary barra today the ceo of gm that be move forward at the same time as the ford project be move forward in rawsonville michigan and i ’ ve issue a challenge to those two company à la “ ford v ferrari ” — this be ford versus gm let ’ s see who get those ventilators out first now the second point of the compass which these two order address today be this allocation of resource issue the ventilator company themselves express concern that in this rush to build ventilators there would be pressure on that supply chain so what they request that we do and the president do be to use the dpa to give this gentleman here — who ’ s one of the strongest gentlemen in the world in term of apply things — be to give him the ability to prioritize that supply chain for those ventilator manufacturers and he will do things like give them what ’ s call a “ do rat ” in the defense procurement which will allow them to get what they need now the second order which the president sign today have to do with the other part of the equation which be once they make the stuff okay do it go to the right folks and this be a order and to be frank over the last several days we ’ ve have some issue make sure that all of the production that do around the world — enough of it be come back here to the right place so what ’ s go to happen with the sign of that order in trump time be we ’ re go to resolve that issue with probably by tomorrow at close of business because we can ’ t afford to lose days or hours or even minutes in this crisis now the third part of the compass — this third point there — this get to the hoard issue the president stand up here with — he ’ s the commanderinchief but we have a sheriff in town too attorney general barr and he stand up here with attorney general barr and bill barr say “ i ’ m go to go out and bust them and guess what three days ago doj go into a warehouse in jersey grab ppe and the beauty of that — the beauty of that it wasn ’ t only seize but within hours it be turn around and give to healthcare professionals in new york and new jersey that ’ s a beautiful thing that ’ s a beautiful case of use the dpa now what ’ s go to happen tomorrow be the president be go to sign another order which be in the work this be interest there be a black market spring up which you have describe where we ’ re have people bid against each other broker come in they ’ re bid and bid on all this different ppe it ’ s drive the price up and guess what you know where it ’ s go the domestic source here be be export when president trump hear about that he say “ that ’ s not go to happen anymore under my watch so tomorrow we ’ re bring that order and what it ’ s go to do be it ’ s go to empower customs and border protection with the help of people like the post office and express mail consigners like up to basically deal with that issue so we be go to crack down unmercifully and i would say to the hoarders out there and the broker that be try to make money off of the misery of people in this country around the world that ’ s get to stop and if you ’ ve get inventory what you need to do be pick up a phone and not call somebody out in — around the world you call fema and say “ we get some stuff we ’ ll give it to you at a fair price and be do with that because that stuff have absolutely get to stop inaudible mr navarro so that ’ s — that ’ s — hang on hang on so that ’ s — that ’ s what we ’ re go to be look for and when we hear case like this we ’ re go to aggressively issue order after order to crack down on it now before — this be not my role to take a bunch of question but let me tell you one other thing before i leave the podium it ’ s a story which i ’ d love to share with you today because this again illustrate the key principles of this president and this vice president which be to wed the full force of the federal government with the full power of private enterprise and just two days ago we at the white house get an urgent sos from the chief of police of the new york police department and they be in a situation now because of the strain on their resources where personnel such as their homicide detectives be have to go on into house and deal with covid issue without protective gear now the beauty of this president be because of his leadership we be able to solve that problem in two phone call two phone call the first one go to phebe novakovic at the general dynamics “ phebe can you call tom kennedy at raytheon i need you guy to basically scoop up all the tyvek suit you can and find any gloves you can ” this president under his leadership and the voluntary efforts and the pride and patriotism you talk about it earlier that — we have tyvek suit deliver to the new york pd within hours that ’ s — that ’ s a new record in trump time at the same time a second phone call be make the tara engel at pernod ricard and laura lane at up they be on the same phone call and i say “ tara laura we get this issue they need hand sanitizer literally within two hours we have drum gallons of hand sanitizer on a up truck head up to the nypd and it probably arrive today with a promise from pernod that they will continue to supply the nypd throughout the course of this crisis so this be a beautiful thing that america be rally to we be become a stronger more unite nation and i couldn ’ t be more proud of this president this administration these guy up here who be do a heck of a job organize the supply chain and my promise to you be that the president be go to use that dpa to make sure that the american people particularly our healthcare professionals get the ppe the medicine everything we need so let me — let me stop there i don ’ t think it ’ s my place here to field a bunch of question the president no you ’ re do a good job thank you mr navarro thank you mr navarro what ’ s the status of the “ buy american ” executive order the president go ahead go ahead answer — mr navarro sure the president you go ahead mr navarro okay — the president come here come here come mr navarro one of the — one of the things that this crisis have teach us sir be that we be dangerously overdependent on a global supply chain for our medicine like penicillin our medical supply like mask and our medical equipment like ventilators we have — right now as we speak over countries have already impose some form of export restrictions in their country against the rest of the world and what we ’ ve — what we ’ re learn from that be that no matter how many treaties you have no matter how many alliances no matter how many phone call when push come to shove you run the risk as a nation of not have what you need and if there ’ s any vindication of the president ’ s “ buy american secure border and a strong manufacture base ” philosophy strategy and belief it be this crisis — because it underscore everything that we see there so the “ buy american ” order which — which be go through process would do a couple things it would simply say — not during this crisis because we don ’ t want to disrupt anything i want to be really clear about that but go forward after this be over the va dod hhs and this government buy american for essential medicine our medical countermeasures and the medical supply and equipment we need at the same time it will deregulate so we can get the fda and epa to facilitate domestic manufacture and then innovate because the key here — the key here be have advance manufacture on us soil that can leapfrog other countries so we don ’ t have to worry about compete against cheap sweatshop labor lax environmental regulations different tax regimes and the massive subsidies of foreign governments who be actually directly attack our industrial base so be patient with that sir it ’ s — the other priorities we have right now be to dpa and what the task force be do but if we learn anything from this crisis it should be never again never again should we have to depend on the rest of the world for our essential medicine and countermeasures the president and by the way we ’ ve cut them out also to be honest we ’ ve stop order go from certain place and in a couple of place — like we have a big order go to italy on important outfit and some ventilators and it be go to italy they make the order a long time ago and i say “ you get to let it go they have an order and i could have cut it under the act i could have cut it i say “ nope you can ’ t do that you get to let it go you know they have big problems we have an order go to spain and i say “ let it go i could have stop it i say “ let it go we ’ re go to be fine i say “ let it go so it work that way also one other thing as to your question oftentimes — and we ’ ve tell this to the governors — mike we ’ ve be very strong on this — have — if you think there ’ s bid between federal government and state let us know and we ’ ll drop out immediately or you drop out and we lower the price but state be bid against each other the president no no if we ’ re bid against each other i say find out who it be and usually they know everyone know and we ’ re notify and we get notify and we ’ ll either drop out or they ’ ll drop out but we have another problem there be countries out there beyond the state there be countries that have this problem and they ’ re order too it ’ s really a mess now in a little while the hardest thing to get be the ventilators because they ’ re — you know it take a while to build them and we have a lot we have thousands of them be build right now in a little while they ’ ll be worth about five dollars but right now they ’ re very valuable and we ’ re go to have a lot of them be ship and in fact that ’ s why general motor call up before — mary that ’ s why others call up two days ago they call up that they ’ re all in production and they ’ ll start — they ’ re start to arrive in a week and a half but there ’ ll be a time when we ’ re go to build stockpile by the way the state should have be build their stockpile we have almost in our stockpile and we ’ ve be build it and we ’ ve be supply it but the state should be build we ’ re a backup we ’ re not an order clerk we ’ re a backup and we ’ ve do an unbelievable job like for instance who ever hear of a governor call up “ sir can you build us a hospital of room and we build it “ can you build us four medical center we build it “ can you deliver a ship — a hospital ship — with room and we do it and we do it in los angeles too we ’ ve be an unbelievable — we ’ ve do an unbelievable job — these people and so — and thousands of people behind them but we ’ re a backup ideally those hospitals would have have all this equipment ideally those state should have have all this equipment and i think they will the next time you know you hear the case where thousands of ventilators could have be have at a very inexpensive price three years ago and a certain state decide not to exercise that right because they want to build a road or they want to build something else because it ’ s big money you ’ re talk about — i think it be a billion dollars but you ’ re talk about a lot of money for something that may never happen because normally on a ventilator — other than a pandemic or an epidemic — you wouldn ’ t — you wouldn ’ t need anything like this hospitals have three ventilators — big hospitals — and they get by with it and now they want thousands i mean they want thousands of ventilators you call up a governor and he ’ ll say “ sir could you send us ventilators nobody have ever hear of a thing like this so they ’ ve do some job let me just tell you when secretary mnuchin speak they want you to call not “ com ” but sbagov — okay — for the application and for information okay so it ’ s sba — small business — sbagov okay if you don ’ t mind yeah let ’ s go please thank you sir thank you mr president i want to follow up from a question yesterday regard i think your administration ’ s denial of the expansion of obamacare special enrollment period in the wake of this pandemic in your own word — vp pence give a fiveminute nonanswer — but people face this pandemic — illness and even worse — most experts say that have healthcare be critical to our nation ’ s health and financial wellbeing the president right can you assure americans tonight that you will reopen obamacare marketplace so that they can be cover in this time of combine health — the president well we ’ re — we ’ re do better than that — and financial crisis the president yeah no i understand the question and we ’ re do better than that we ’ re go to try and get a cash payment to the people and we ’ re work out the mechanics of that with legislature so we ’ re go to try and get them a cash payment because just open it up doesn ’ t help as much so we ’ re go to work it out so we ’ re go to try and get for that certain group of people — it ’ s a certain group of people — a cash payment go ahead i really want to ask you about mask but i also just want to follow up on a couple of hang thread there on just the question earlier about the bid what happen though when state be bid against each other on those market the president well they have that and they have to work that out what they should do be they should have — long before this pandemic arrive they should have be on the open market just buy there be no competition you could have make a great price the state have to stock up it ’ s like one of those things they wait they didn ’ t want to spend the money because they think this would never happen and their shelve in some case be bare and by the way in some case they weren ’ t they be beautifully service they do a good job but in some case their shelve be bare so the best thing they can do be when time become normalize — and they will hopefully soon — and actually you ’ re go to have a lot of excess material because so much be be do right now in term of protective gear protective outfit a lot be be do it ’ s go to be — within six months it ’ s go to be sell for the right price they get to stack up for the next time but we be do that and the admiral have do a fantastic job senator schumer write a letter today and he say “ you should put a military man in charge i say “ well chuck if you know a little bite more we have one of the most highly respect people in the military the admiral this be what he do too very professionally and he ’ s in charge but chuck didn ’ t know that okay jeff please mr president you tweet this morning about your call with saudi arabia ’ s mbs the president yeah we ’ ve have some people say that the figure that you cite — between million and million barrel per day — be not what they ’ re agree to can you be more specific about what exactly they tell us the president i don ’ t know what they ’ re agree to i think they might agree to more than that look russia — russia — do he tell you that sir the president yeah he do say that actually russia talk about million barrel russia and saudi arabia be fight over this and as everybody know it ’ s you know really kill an industry hurt russia badly hurt saudi arabia badly i say “ this be an easy one it should be an easy one and it may be and it may be more than that i be actually tell it may be as i tell somebody before it may be and it may be more than that maybe it ’ s maybe it go up to could be as high as and you know there ’ s a tremendous oversupply right now that industry be — it be oversupplied before the virus and when the virus come along they lose percent of the world and there ’ s an unbelievable — you can ’ t get a ship now every ship be load to the gills sit out someplace in the ocean they ’ re storage tank they ’ re not even ship they ’ re storage tank so it would be great for russia it would be great for saudi arabia i hope they make that deal but that ’ s what they tell me they say — inaudible million be — the president — they say it ’ s — — enough to address the oversupply issue the president well i think it will be hopefully soon i think hopefully they ’ ll announce something soon now can a deal be break can something happen where it doesn ’ t happen i guess in which case there ’ s another alternative but i ’ d rather not see that other alternative i hope they can make a deal what do you mean when you say the “ alternative ” the president they both want — i think they both want to make a deal and they ’ re both smart they love their countries they want to make a deal it ’ s good but it ’ s also good for the world if they do because you save an industry mr president — the president yeah please go ahead go ahead in the back please what do you by “ cash payments ” the president i ’ m go to let mike because we go over this very specifically and i ’ ll let you talk about it mike because you respond last time the vice president right thank you mr president as i say yesterday the president have put a priority on ensure that no american have to worry about the cost of coronavirus test and we ’ ve be work every day to make sure that americans don ’ t have to worry about the cost of treatment and at this point the white house coronavirus task force be work on a proposal for the president to use some of the billion that we ’ re make available to hospitals to compensate the hospitals directly for any coronavirus treatment that they provide to uninsured americans we ’ re work out the detail of that the president will make a final decision tomorrow we expect an announcement but the president have make it very clear we don ’ t want american to worry about the cost of get a test or the cost of get treatment and we ’ ve expand coverage through medicaid we ’ ve expand coverage through medicare health insurance company around the country include blue cross just today announce that all of their members will be waive all copayments on coronavirus treatment but for those some million uninsured americans the president have direct the coronavirus task force to find a way to make sure that they know we will find a way to pay for your coronavirus treatment and the president will be address that and announce that tomorrow mr president — the president go ahead — a point of clarification and then a followup question yesterday you say that you speak to florida governor ron desantis before he issue his stayathome order do you advise him to issue that order the president no but i talk to him about it and he want to do what ’ s right for the people of florida he ’ s be a great governor you could see that just by his popularity which be extraordinary we ’ re proud of him he ’ s do a fantastic job and he make the decision but we speak before he make the decision yes and he have also say that he be consider put people who be suspect of have coronavirus or who have test for positive for it in isolation center and that he would potentially use — the president that i haven ’ t hear no that i haven ’ t hear so he hasn ’ t consult with you the president i haven ’ t hear that yes please thank you mr president ebony bowden from the new york post a few hours ago mayor de blasio the mayor of new york say that new yorkers leave their home should wear mask they should also wear mask when they ’ re with other people be you consider that kind of recommendation on a federal level and if you be how would you prevent a rush on mask the president well i think they ’ re go to be come out with regulations on that and if people want to abide by them frankly i don ’ t think you — i don ’ t think there ’ ll be mandatory because some people don ’ t want to do that but if people want — as an example on the mask if people want to wear them they can if people want to use scarves which they have — many people have them — they can in many case the scarf be better it ’ s thicker i mean you can — if you — depend on the material it ’ s thicker but they can do that if they want now a recommendation be come out we ’ ll see what that recommendation be but — be that a cdc recommendation sir the president but i will say this they can pretty much decide for themselves right now would that be nationwide and can i also just ask– the president nationwide nationwide — the president yeah — not just for hotspots and then i think this be best for dr birx but we ’ ve hear some differ guidance here the who and even the surgeon general have talk about various study that show that mask in addition to maybe not even be helpful to protect people may actually increase the rat of illness because people touch the mask then they touch themselves the president sure can you talk a little bite about just the evolution of — the president all right maybe i will ask — — your think on this the president — dr birx and you might mention that other point also yeah thank dr birx no no thank you so i hope you get from the conference today that we ’ re triangulate data that we know from the case number the test number the supplychain number to create an integrate picture so that we can really support hospitals in their need and i think that level of granularity be really critical secondly i just want to make the point that we really applaud the governors that be look at a wholeofstate or a wholeofmetro approach and what do i mean by that the unite state go into this have about ventilators across the unite state and another to anesthesia machine that ’ s about five time what most of the european countries have but it ’ s a matter of distribution to need and i really applaud the governors that be bring together their public hospitals with their more private hospitals and their visibility across their state because what we try to talk about yesterday be every state every county be different and that ’ s why we ’ re look at it at that level of granularity and as we move through this epidemic the need need to be very tailor to those counties and frankly those hospitals i mean there ’ s a reason why the president and mr kushner have be very much involve in find out what the public hospitals need why be that because the public hospital sometimes have the weakest supply chain because they ’ re often sometimes not as attractive to private sector distributors or they may be too busy care for the need of patients to be really on top of their order form and their supply chain so really listen to the community that ’ s at the front of this fight and get feedback from those specific communities no matter where they be and listen to the frontline healthcare workers because it ’ s their reality that be important to all of us whether you ’ re the mayor or the governor or the federal government and if they ’ re say they need something we have to work together to supply that and so that ’ s what you ’ re see with this triangulation every county will move through this differently and that allow us to move around these vital issue that protect the frontline healthcare workers and protect the patients through the ventilators to make sure that the supply chain be align with the need as it happen now you have to have very good data in order to be will to work in that level of granularity and that ’ s what we ’ ve be work on to really develop that level of granularity to ensure that so i just want to say one other thing about test just to give you the bottomline data of what we ’ re see we appreciate the group who be report not everyone be report yet and this be part of us try to understand at a very granular level we do have two state that do have percent positives and that ’ s new york and new jersey so that confirm very clearly that that ’ s a very clear and important hot zone louisiana though have percent of their test be positive michigan connecticut indiana georgia illinois — so that should tell you where the next hotspots be come — be at percent test positive and then colorado dc rhode island and massachusetts be at percent there ’ s a significant number of state still under percent everyone that i didn ’ t discuss california and washington remain steady at an percent rate so what we ’ re see finally be test improve — more test be do still a high level of negative — in state without hotspots allow them to do more of the surveillance and containment and then prioritize this new rapid test kit to those areas that may not have the same amount of access — to the indian health service and to the public health institutions and the public health and state labs so that they can use that and start forward lean into surveillance now we know there be people wait for test and they ’ re wait for test because when these areas become very — when they get onto the logarithmic curve we prioritize people whose decisions — where the test decision would make it critical for their care and so we prioritize hospitals and we prioritize nurse and doctor and frontline workers the president good dr birx so that mean if you go through a drivethrough or you go through your doctor you could have that delay so the mask so what i try to give you be how we ’ re use data in a very granular way and so there be — there be experiential data when you look at communities that have oftentimes utilize mask — in general for personal protection — from when they particularly be themselves sick and have use their mask in public and we ’ ve look at the rate of this in those populations and then we ’ re look at the scientific evidence to bring those two piece together let me just say one thing though the most important thing be the social distance and wash your hand and we don ’ t want people to get an artificial sense of protection because they ’ re behind a mask because if they ’ re touch things — remember your eye be not in the mask so if you ’ re touch things and then touch your eye you ’ re expose yourself in the same way so we don ’ t want people to feel like “ oh i ’ m wear a mask i ’ m protect and i ’ m protect others you may be protect others but don ’ t get a false sense of security that that mask be protect you exclusively from get infect because there be other ways that you can get infect because of the number of asymptomatic and mild case that be out there and so this worry us and that ’ s why the debate be continue about the mask because we don ’ t want — when we ’ re try to send a signal that every single person in this country need to stay six feet away from everybody that need to be wash their hand constantly and know where their hand be — to send a signal that we think a mask be equivalent to those piece so in the — when the advisory come out it will be an additive piece if it come out rather than say “ this be a substitute for… and we want to make sure everybody understand it be not a substitute for the presidential guidelines that have already go out and to be absolutely clear about that dr birx can i ask a follow up about the test please the president go ahead dr birx there ’ s a lot of evidence we ’ re see — that the experts be say that a high number of these test could be produce false — false negative so — dr birx of the roche and abbott test that as many as one in three test might be provide false negative and i be wonder — maybe you could explain or — dr birx that would be almost be impossible with — — tell a little about the science dr birx — have percent positives you — if that be true you would have percent positive — be you concern about the underlie data — dr birx — or percent positive so what i can tell you be the number of positive test be track very closely with the number of case diagnose so i don ’ t — i will look into that i look at the roche and abbott number every night they ’ re trend exactly in the same way and that ’ s important when you ’ re validate data to really validate “ do this same site ” — in other word i ’ m look between test sit to see be there consistencies be there an anomaly to make sure for what you just very specifically ask so i will go back and look at it more carefully i haven ’ t see that kind of anomaly this be — this same platform be be use across the country and that ’ s a range from what i report percent positivity up to percent positivity and that range reflect also what we ’ re see with the hotspots and the number of case and frankly – i mean we hate to talk about it but it also track with the hospitalizations independent of diagnosis and the mortality that we ’ re see so all of those piece validate together there ’ s no concern that there might – people might be get a false sense of security or that we might not be see all of the data here on – and who have it dr birx well i ’ m tell you i ’ m still miss percent of the data from report i have test report in we ’ ve do million so there be — and it could be those sit so we do need to see all — the bill say you need to report we ’ re still not receive percent of the test dr birx with regard to the test the president ’ s sample collection take one minute result report back in minutes i realize you ’ re the president of the unite state but when will everyone get to take a test that work that quickly and you get result that quickly dr birx so these be new test and we have prioritize the group that we think have the least access to test now and who do we mean by that we mean the indian health service — they ’ re often in remote areas rural areas the governors of the northwestern state that may not have the advantage of these highthroughput machine that be often across the east coast and in high metro areas — colorado — and then across the west coast so we ’ ve prioritize the presidential test to the indian health service and public health labs so that they can support nurse home test and other areas where we think surveillance be absolutely key so at this moment they ’ re prioritize in that way the vice president it ’ s thirteen to twelve hundred dr birx yes of them be go out that way so do more of those test need to be make in order for more people — the president they be be make dr birx yeah okay so in a matter of – the president they ’ re move very quickly — it ’ s happen — in this case dr birx so i ’ m glad you ask that because today there ’ s of these machine already out there we ’ re try to find out exactly where everyone be because you can see that give you amaze flexibility because if people would allow it to be loan to a state that ’ s in a hotspot or a state where you want to do additional surveillance test machine be a huge amount and it really get to your very question about how we can prioritize what we have at the same time we ’ re move out what be new and so really figure out who should those go to how — who can we ask communities — because these will be in the community — to share those machine into the community who need the test now and i think that ’ s really an incredible question that really need to be answer over the next hours dr birx a point of clarity about the facecovering guidance you say it ’ s still a point of debate you say — you use the phrase “ the guidance if it come out be the guidance come out and when the vice president yes yes and — and when sir the vice president in the — in the days ahead we ’ re currently work through the task force take the consultation advice of cdc our top health experts and we ’ ll be bring forward the guidance from the cdc in the next several days dr birx just remember it ’ s not a substitute for everything that we ’ re ask people to do and just to — to everybody out there across the country when we say no gather of we ’ re look at — we want it to be clear if you have a family of we don ’ t want you to be split up but we don ’ t expect people to be have dinner party cocktail party i mean i know you ’ ve see the slope in the unite state versus the slope in italy and we have to change that slope we have to change the logarithmic curve that we ’ re on we see country after country have do that what it mean in the unite state be not everyone be do it so we ’ re only as strong as every community every county every state every american follow the guidelines to a t and i can tell by the curve and as it be today that not every american be follow it and so this be really a call to action we see spain we see italy we see france we see germany when we see others begin to bend their curve we can bend ours but it mean everybody have to take that same responsibility as americans mr president dr birx do that mean — mr president can i have a quick followup on oil please in your conversations with russia and saudi arabia do you have to make any concessions to get them to agree to cut their production the president no like do you agree to cut us production of oil the president no no we didn ’ t discuss that they want to do that that ’ s good for their countries and we do not discuss that now mr president nbc news have learn that the navy be set to fire the captain of the uss theodore roosevelt after he raise red flag about the outbreak on his ship it appear as if he ’ s be punish for try to save the live of the sailors in his command what ’ s your assessment the president oh i don ’ t think so at all but we ’ re go to wait a little while because i understand there ’ s a news conference by the secretary of defense about that but you know i don ’ t — i don ’ t agree with that at all not at all not even a little bite yeah mr president thank you this morning you say once again that new york get off to a late start and they should have push harder but governors and other state leaders say they rely on the federal government to assess the situation and how risky it be and they want to know how would they have know to start sooner without your guidance the president well they have experts and frankly long after we come out and talk about it — look how would i have know to cut off china i cut off china very early and if i didn ’ t we would have a chart that you wouldn ’ t believe so how would i know to do that how would i know to cut off europe i cut off europe very early i mean you have to make a decision people know that some bad things be go on and they get off to a late start and some others get off to a late start also but we cut off china if we didn ’ t cut off china we would have be in some big trouble and we cut it off but do — the president and you know what we cut it off way early go ahead mr president to follow up on the insurance point and a separate question that come in from a colleague who can ’ t be in the room — the president too bad on the insurance point be there go to — the president who be you with who be you with roll call be there go to be an opportunity for insurance company — if in fact hospitals be compensate for uncompensated care – the president right right — be the insurance company go to also get compensate for extraordinary expense that they may have or be they assume that cost the president so we haven ’ t discuss it but we ’ re talk to them you know get them not to pay copays in the case of the big ones be a tremendous thing that ’ s a lot of money they give up but we ’ re discuss that with the insurance company okay the president we ’ ll let you know it ’ ll be pretty quickly yeah go ahead on — i have a question on japan sir they be expand their entry ban to include the unite state be you plan to take any similar action to ban japanese nationals from come to the us as a result of this crisis the president well we ’ re look at a lot of things and a lot of different ban we have more ban than anybody we have ban when ban weren ’ t fashionable if you remember right at the begin of this administration it be for different reason but we ’ ve have ban long before people think of ban when i do china it have never be do before i be the first one to do it remember that it have never — accord to what i read in all the paper this have never be do this be a terrible thing to do and four weeks later they be all say “ we ’ re lucky we do it so we ’ re look at it no we hear that and i think it ’ s fine that they do that they ’ re try to protect their country and we have to protect our country yeah please mr president – mr president i ask you yesterday about stayathome order – the president yeah — and if that you know decision should be leave in the hand of governors or if you ’ re consider tell the entire nation “ stay at home ” the president yeah so just today the — georgia ’ s governor finally issue a stayathome order – the president yeah — say that individuals could have be infect people before they ever felt bad but we didn ’ t know that until the last hours be that ignorance gross incompetence the president he ’ s a good governor brian kemp he ’ s a very good – you ’ ve be have call with these governors the president he ’ s a good governor and he have to make his own decision on that i let the state — i think we ’ re about percent positive on that if you look i think it ’ s about percent of the state have get the stayathome brian be a great governor we ’ ll — it ’ s his decision he make that decision ultimately he decide to go along with it do you think it be smart decision to wait the president and they ’ re do — and they ’ re do well and the state be do well in many respect yeah go ahead please this be another question from a colleague who couldn ’ t make it in today from emily goodin at the daily mail i have a question in regard to the russian plane that land at jfk with medical supply do the unite state ask russia for this aid or be it just accept it the president we ’ re accept it it be a very nice offer from president putin i speak to him the other night as i tell you and they have excess medical equipment things and i ’ ll take it i ’ ll take it he just offer you — the president i think it ’ s very nice we ’ ve have some from china we also help other countries we like do that like i say before if we have excess stuff we let it go out we let some go out where frankly they have order for it and i didn ’ t want to stop order it be a very nice gesture on behalf of president putin and i could ’ ve say “ no thank you ” or i could have say “ thank you and it be a large plane of very highquality medical supply and i say “ i ’ ll take it ” be he offer any further aid in your conversation the president i think he would if we ask for it but he be very nice it be part of the call he suggest — he say “ we have it it ’ s additional they have very big difficulties with this virus also as you know — russia i think it be a very nice gesture on behalf of president putin i could have say “ no i don ’ t want it ” or i could have say “ i ’ ll take it and you know what i say “ i ’ ll take it ” and would you accept further aid the president i think so yeah if they send things that we need i ’ d take it sure nice gesture be there concern about russians use it as propaganda the president i ’ m not concern about russian propaganda not even a little bite he offer a lot of medical highquality stuff that i accept and that may save a lot of live i ’ ll take it every day please in the back mr president you say — in january you tweet that you stand with the people of iran since the begin of your presidency and you ’ ll continue to stand with the people of iran give the fact that they ’ re so hard hit with the coronavirus — the president oh they ’ re very hard hit they ’ re very hard hit but would you consider — the president in a lot of ways they ’ re hard hit they ’ re hit in — with their economy with their military and with obviously the virus they ’ re very hard hit would you consider ease sanction to allow medical supply to get in the president well they haven ’ t even ask us to do that okay but we know that sanction hit the people not the government the president you know what they haven ’ t even ask us to do that but how do a person — the president if they want to meet we ’ d love to meet and we ’ d love to settle the whole thing out but i doubt they ’ ll be — but how do a — realistically how do a person in tehran pick up the phone and call you i mean — the president i think they love america i think the iranians love america i think they ’ d love to be free i think they ’ d love to have just some of the things that we have you know i remember iran many years ago — friends of mine be always in iran they be do real estate deal in iran they be build beautiful build all over iran apartment house it be — they be very successful and then one day that come to an end but you know what the people of iran they remember that it be a long time ago but not so long ago and they remember it and i ’ ll tell you they love america they love what we stand for and we ’ re not look for cha — we ’ re not look for government takeover government change you know this country have be through that many time that doesn ’ t work so inaudible health of the people would you encourage other countries to — who be maybe concern about run afoul — the president well what i do — yeah what i do as you know — — of sanction to — the president — i put it out very publicly with respect to iran i say if they need help with respect to the virus we ’ d love to send — we have the greatest medical professionals in the world we ’ d love to send them over so what countries be you encourage perhaps to — to lend their support because there be many countries that feel — the president i ’ m not encourage or discourage they ’ ve be a very hostile country they make a deal that president obama should have never make it be a shortterm deal give them billion give them billion in cash green fill up this room five time look — but your administration — do you have a moral responsibility to — the president no not at all nobody have even ask me about it i have a moral responsibility to help them if they ask if they — if they need help i would certainly consider different things well the unite nations say they need help the president well that ’ s up to the unite nations i ’ m talk about us and what happen be if they want help — because they have a very big case of virus a very very big case it — one of the worst on earth if you believe what you ’ re read and i happen to believe what i see and what i know and if they want help we ’ d give them help yeah you have one in the back please yes mr president and a question for jar too the — you talk about a granular approach to receive data from these different state and regions to try and figure out what they need the president — you just enact the dpa on ventilators and mask be there be signal from across the country that might indicate there be other things besides mask and ventilators that be slowly kind of rise in term of need — like hand sanitizer for instance the president go ahead mr kushner sure so the first — the first issue that we ’ ve be deal with be really the ventilators that be the number one number two and number three from all the state what we ’ ve be find be that people have a lot of these request base on the model and what we ’ ve be try to do over at fema be say to the state “ well if you would like ventilators we need to see — first look in your state right so for example in northern jersey they ’ re go down to southern jersey and they ’ re find ventilators and try to relocate them to where they have their hotspots the second thing that we ’ ve do ask them to survey for alternative ventilators dr birx speak before about the anesthesia machine and the ability to — to convert them to be ventilators so we ’ re ask people to be resourceful inside their state before they come to the federal government the third thing we ’ ve be ask state to do be to provide what their daily utilization rat be so everyone be ask for everything one congressman get a call from his local hospital say “ i need ventilators and he say “ well you don ’ t have a covid patient within four counties why do you want ventilators and he say “ well we just want to be safe we ’ re very nervous right now ” so what you have all over the country be a lot of people be ask for things that they don ’ t necessarily need at the moment and the job of fema and admiral polowczyk have be to try to make sure that we ’ re get the real data from the cities from the state so that we can make realtime allocation decisions base on the data and right now what ’ s happen be a lot of the different cities and state be provide fema that — that information we ’ re talk to them daily they ’ re update that information daily and that ’ s enable the federal government to make much more inform decisions on where they position ventilators you also have a situation where in some state fema allocate ventilators to the state and you have instance where in cities they ’ re run out but the state still have a stockpile and the notion of the federal stockpile be it ’ s suppose to be our stockpile it ’ s not suppose to be state stockpile that they then use so we ’ re encourage the state to make sure that they ’ re assess the need they ’ re get the data from their local — local situations and then try to fill it with the supply that we ’ ve give them the same thing with the mask so the mask be actually an item that wasn ’ t use as frequently in the medical profession before this it be use mostly for diseases so speak to a lot of the doctor and hospital administrators they would say they use actually a very low percentage of the mask what the president and the vice president be able to do with congress be to get the waiver so that you could expand the pool because a lot of the mask be use to — for the construction industries now there ’ s a much bigger pool of mask in the country there be a stockpile they distribute that base on where they anticipate a lot of the need would go but a lot of that still be stick with the state and it hasn ’ t trickle down to the right place within the state so i would just encourage you when you have governors say that the federal government haven ’ t — hasn ’ t give them what they need i would just urge you to ask them “ well have you look within your state to make sure that you haven ’ t be able to find the resources ” unlike other countries a lot of the medical system in america be a private — it ’ s not a — it ’ s not a public governmentcontrolled so you have to get the data from what ’ s in their state look at it in that way and then make sure that they ’ re be resourceful in a way to do that and also ask them what their utilization percentage be because if one governor be ask for more ventilators and if the federal government send them more than they need the goal here be not to have ventilators sit in a warehouse where you have another state or you have people who need them so what we ’ re try to do be make inform datadriven decisions both on ventilators mask any other supply we can get to make sure it ’ s go to the people who need them i wonder if you could weigh in on the report of which i ’ m sure you ’ re aware where unnamed white house officials have describe your role as be something of run a shadow task force how do you describe your role how do you describe the qualifications you bring to your role mr kushner yeah i would just say very simply — look the president ask the vice president to run the task force the vice president ask me to assist i ’ ve be serve really at the direction of vice president and he ’ s ask me to get involve in different project the vice president and i speak probably sometimes time a day but everything that i ’ m do be at the direction of the vice president if some people be talk to you that mean they ’ re probably not inform as to what ’ s go on but i can assure you that i ’ m speak with dr birx dr fauci the vice president and the president multiple time a day to make sure that i ’ m accomplish and focus on the objectives that the vice president deem a priority jar a followup on the ventilators — the president or they don ’ t exist — and the national stockpile the president or the source don ’ t exist they ’ re fake persons okay a lot of fake source out there they don ’ t exist i read about it — for a long time i ’ ve be read a lot of them — fake source they don ’ t exist go ahead please thank you mr president jar what trigger send a ventilator from the national stockpile to a state in other word how sick do somebody have to be to get one of these national ventilators mr kushner well that ’ s not the issue that we ’ re — that ’ s not the criteria you have the state basically put in the request and they ’ re give us their utilization — their utilization percentages so it ’ s a very simple formula the state should know how many ventilators they have in their state and by the way some governors you speak to or senators they don ’ t know what ’ s in their state you know some governors i ’ ll speak to and they ’ ll know to the number how many ventilators they have in their state because that ’ s the first thing a good manager will do what a lot of the voters be see now be that when you elect somebody to be a mayor or a governor or a president you ’ re try to think about who will be a competent manager during the time of crisis this be a time of crisis and you ’ re see certain people be better managers than others so what i would say be that the way that the federal government be try to allocate be they ’ re try to make sure a you have your data right don ’ t ask us for things when you know that — when you don ’ t know what you have in your own state just because you ’ re scar you ask your medical professionals and they don ’ t know you have to take inventory of what you have in your own state and then you have to be able to show that there ’ s a real need and so we prepositioned a lot of things because most governors off the bat didn ’ t know what they need but fema have a joint command with admiral polowczyk admiral giroir and pete gaynor where every couple hours when their request come in they evaluate the request they all vote on the request and then if there be something that they want to elevate to the taskforce they bring it to the vice president to make a recommendation the vice president and jar if i may you might ask deborah to — we ’ re literally track hospitalization case on a daily basis interact with governors and health systems and that inform our supply chain decisions dr birx yeah i really — i want to thank the health commissioners and all of them that have be send hospital data and i think it ’ s really critical and important to all of us new york city have be provide information new jersey connecticut rhode island and certainly louisiana in these hotspots and that allow us — we can see where they be with the rise number of case where they be in their curve what can be predict and really ensure that people get what they need as they need it and so i think many of the governors now and the health commissioners have be “ i have to use ” — “ i ’ m intubate people a day now i have enough for th next three days if that doubles…we ’ re see our hospitalization rat stabilize but we still think there will be this many more in the next days that ’ s the information that they then translate into provide the ventilators so when you see the ventilator number go out they ’ re go out in and because i think early on we send a big bolus out and then not all of them even today have be fully utilize and so we want to make sure every state and every hotspot can be reassure that ventilators be there for them as they move through the curve and i think to date we ’ ve be able to do that and i think that ’ s what ’ s important to me be that people have what they need when they need it and to date people who have need ventilators have be able to get on ventilators and i think that ’ s our goal with governors and with the mayor to make sure that that continue to happen but that mean all of us have to work together and i think that ’ s what ’ s be really important over the last few weeks be people be not make generic request anymore they ’ re make datadriven request because they know precisely what ’ s happen in their hospitals dr birx when you be up here a little bite ago you talk about the curve and what you ’ re see and you ’ re concern that people be not abide by the social distance guidelines i mean you seem in your voice to be quite concern about that have the curve change enough at this point where that to people be likely to die have that shift upwards at all dr birx no it ’ s just when i look at what — so we ’ re in week in our guidelines and i guess what i expect when the president put out guidelines that say “ don ’ t go to bar don ’ t be in group more than people ” when we say that now over days ago that be serious and then you could see what happen subsequently and you can see the number of individuals have be infect since then because the people we ’ re see infect today and in hospitals today be infect after the guidelines go out so that ’ s what we ’ re worry about and we ’ re worry about that we ’ re not — we ’ re still in this and that ’ s why the president extend it for days but we have to get out of this we have to start see this the president but deborah aren ’ t you refer to just a few state because many of those state be dead flat i mean so — dr birx yes the president so it ’ s hard to get — it ’ s hard to be — dr birx yes there be state that be dead flat but you know every — what change the curve be a new detroit a new chicago a new new orleans a new colorado those change the curve because it all of a sudden spike with the number of new case because you have a certain projection of new case and then a whole other city come on top where they ’ re in their logarithmic phase so those ones that i talk about that have test result greater than percent positive all of those — all of those state or all of those counties be in logarithmic phase that mean there be a lot of counties that aren ’ t and we be really — we ’ re excite about those counties that have be test and still find quite flat and hopefully maybe sunday or so or sometime this weekend we can go through all the state and the curve again so you can see where you know that california and washington be still steady but we ’ re watch very carefully because we see that you can go from this to this very quickly and what — this should not be happen any longer in new place if people be do the social distance wash their hand not get together in large group more than the president again so i look at the graph all the time dr birx yes you do the president and you have many many — dr birx yes the president — flatliners i call them “ flatliners i ’ m amaze at them and you have a couple that be up it ’ s hard to blame the flatliners for not do a good job dr birx no no i don ’ t want to say that no i don ’ t — no thank you sir i don ’ t want — in fact i want to praise the state that — and i think i want to be able to call them out and show you their graph so you can see they ’ ve have steady small case they ’ re test and they ’ re do a lot of test and their percent of testpositives be under percent i mean we have a whole group of state who be test and their positivity rate be under percent we know what it look like on the logarithmic curve you ’ re in the percent then percent then percent and then percent that ’ s what we ’ re try to prevent and it ’ s the metro areas that be absolutely crucial in this and so if you ’ re in a metro area or you ’ re in a small city please make sure all of your friends and family be follow the guidelines that ’ s the best thing we can do the president no because i saw those pen go five minutes ago they be so — they be thrill and the fact be — yes we compare them to italy one place but we have many place that be — dr birx yes the president — really do great and i think that ’ s what deborah mean she didn ’ t mean all of them so when you write your story tomorrow maybe you ’ ll write it correctly she be talk about one state and another state be you know have a hard time it ’ s — and they ’ re closely associate and by the way the people be do a very good job include the people that live there but when deborah be talk about italy she be talk about the one and then the other be lower and then you have mostly state that have be unbelievable so she wasn ’ t talk about the average of everything she be talk about an individual state which be i think still better than italy italy be have a hard time by the way spain be have a hard time france be have a hard time but our state generally speak it ’ s like lot of different countries all over we have — many of those countries be do a phenomenal job they ’ re really flat and i think that ’ s what you mean dr birx thank you sir the president i don ’ t know i don ’ t want to — i don ’ t want to speak for — but i think — that ’ s what i understand she mean yeah please can i ask a question about that though because coronavirus be present in all state you say before that you — when you implore mayors and governors to be serious about this you say “ once it show up mitigation efforts be too late ” so how do you then square that with this notion that some state be do well i mean the virus doesn ’ t abide by state law the president because some state they stay in better they ’ re not touch they ’ re not — whatever it be they ’ re not go out they ’ re not in group and some state be not probably as good or for whatever reason or they also live a lot closer you know new york be very dense and you know california be pretty dense too and they ’ ve get a very good record go so far we hope it doesn ’ t spike up but it ’ s very flat we have state that be do incredibly well i mean when i look at some of them i look at some state that i would have think maybe wouldn ’ t have do as well and they ’ re really flatlined hope they stay that way i hope they stay that way isn ’ t that the point mr president the president say it jeff sir isn ’ t that the point that you want those state to stay flatlined the president i want them — yeah that ’ s what i ’ m say i mean it seem like you ’ re — the president no no no but when deborah mention about italy and our country she wasn ’ t refer to our country she be refer to one state but she ’ s encourage people to do a better job of follow these social distance measure that ’ s what i ’ m understand it the president okay so my understand — i ’ m go to let her say it but i think that everybody would have to be thrill with the way most state be do thrill i don ’ t think she — be that what you mean the president the flatline — the flatline state — state that have almost no bump i mean i would think now then you have others where for whatever reason they ’ re higher that ’ s different but you can ’ t condemn people live in a flatliner with people live in something where there ’ s the big bump or the bigger bump or more akin to italy where they have some very unique problems in all fairness to italy they have some very unique problems but if you ’ d like to come up and — so how many flatline do we have the president a lot of them and how many do we have — how many how many do we have dr birx so why don ’ t i bring you the whole deck again and we ’ ll divide out the state so you can see them the vice president we ’ ll do it tomorrow dr birx because you really have to see each state separately that ’ s why i start with there be state where you ’ ve hear me talk about how concern i be these be state that before the guidelines go out or right after the guidelines go out — i mean you can look at — it ’ s on the website if you go to the healthdataorg about when governors make clarity about close their state as far as the social distance the wash of the hand the bar the take — do takeout and you can line that up with the presidential guidelines and not all state when the presidential guidelines come out immediately follow the presidential guidelines not all state do there be state that also may have get many more seed from outside communities that certainly be one of the issue that new york and new jersey connecticut and rhode island be face the virus come in from multiple place into those state it be undetected early on and they have a very logarithmic curve what i be say be even one of those curve in one county in one city be one curve too many so i be passionate about everyone follow the guidelines because of the outlier curve maybe that be a better way of put it the president yeah that ’ s exactly — dr birx the outlier curve — the president i think that ’ s perfect dr birx — in specific counties be to make sure that doesn ’ t happen anywhere else so would you feel better if every state do a stayathome order would you feel better dr birx well i think most of the state have do that i think if you — one death from this be one death too many i mean i come out of epidemics and pandemics we know what to do i know we don ’ t have a vaccine and i know we don ’ t have a therapeutic but we know what can be do and others be do it and most of the people in the unite state be do it it ’ s our communities — it ’ s every american that have to make these change and i know they ’ re really hard and i know it ’ s hard to remember i mean i have to say to myself every day because i ’ m around very important people to like never touch anything and i ’ m just like paranoid now about touch things i ’ m sure you all be too i mean we ’ ve get to the place where we don ’ t go to your place on pebble beach we go to the one that ’ s open air because i mean you ’ re try to protect your reporters i mean i understand that we ’ re all try to protect each other and we all have to adapt to this new reality that we ’ re in right now and i believe everybody be try really hard and i ’ m just ask them to try really really hard for these next days because they will make a tremendous difference we see that evidence and so it ’ s like have a vaccine or a therapeutic because we know what work and we ’ re ask everybody to apply what work and i know it take amaze attention to detail because you know the minute you forget or do something you ’ re like “ oh my gosh i should have never do that ” and that ’ s the level of attention it take if cover our face could help us do that and guidelines be come out — the president so i just want to say — look many state have start low and slow and then they stay at a good level some really stay at a great level some — louisiana as an example it be low and slow and they be look great i be watch it because you know it ’ s kind of a place people go to with mardi gras — which sort of be an interest point because after mardi gras it be low and then all of a sudden it go up very rapidly and now it ’ s one of our true hotspots right certain areas of michigan — detroit be — it look like it be do pretty good and then all of a sudden it go up so you have that too but i ’ ll tell you what we have state that have be really incredible in the fact that they have keep so — so low they have not — you haven ’ t see the bump and i hope you don ’ t i hope you don ’ t and you have a couple that for a lot of different reason — and that ’ s not to blame anybody but they be at a higher level but very few i think deborah — i mean i may say i think most people have actually follow the presidential — you can call them whatever you want i would never use the word “ dictate ” because if i use that word i would be in such trouble in fact you ’ ll put me in trouble just that i even mention the think of it okay but we make a recommendation and i think they ’ ve do a good job and maybe they start a little later but maybe they ’ re also more difficult state but we ’ ve do i think on average really phenomenally as a country i think we ’ ve do phenomenally because when you look at that graph the other day — i don ’ t know if you saw it i assume you saw it everybody in the world saw it but you look at all those line on the bottom — one color after another all different represent different state — it ’ s all crowd at the bottom and then you have two that be up but you have — i don ’ t know almost every one of them be down low very low so there be a lot of people listen and i just do — i want to be clear because i don ’ t need headline tomorrow and neither do the country because i don ’ t want this country work so hard and then have press that be in this case maybe misinterpret something because i might have — i might have — when i hear it i be surprise at first too but i understand what deborah mean mr president — can you clear something else up again the president but i think it ’ s very important — because i think it ’ s very important for you to be accurate one other thing just a quick thing so what i find be when governors call me — i mean i think in every case they ’ ve always be so nice so nice and i ’ ve see them and hear them say “ thank you very much you have do a great job ” “ a fantastic job ” in one case “ thank you thank you thank you then i ’ ll see the governor usually of the opposite party in almost all case except maybe one — but in almost all case they ’ re very generous they ’ re very nice they thank me everything be great we ’ re do a great job and then i ’ ll see them on television and just like a different person and i realize there be some people because of politics that if they say “ we want ventilators ” and i ’ ll say “ no jim i want to give you ventilators they ’ ll say “ thank you you be the greatest president that ’ s ever live and then i ’ ll see them quote in a paper or see them on a show and they ’ ll say “ the president didn ’ t come through for me i ’ m very disappoint in the president ” and we have a lot of that they ’ re very happy when they talk to me and then i see them but there be some people if they ask for of something and if i give them they will say — you ’ ll say “ how ’ s the president do “ well we don ’ t like the job to my face they ’ re very nice but then sometimes — i guess they assume i don ’ t watch them or something but i watch very closely yeah please mr president one especially vulnerable population be the prison population and that ’ s — especially with jar here i wonder if you could address what the federal government be do to protect inmates the president well it ’ s vulnerable in that it ’ s close together really i — i can ’ t tell you about age but a lot of young people in prison some people — some state — i have not do that at all but some state be let people out of prison some people be get out that be very serious criminals in some state and i don ’ t like that i don ’ t like it but it ’ s a city or state thing in certain case as you know i think maybe philadelphia come to mind so we ’ ll see you have to see what what ’ s go on and we don ’ t like it the people don ’ t like it and we ’ re look in to see if i have the right to stop it in some case okay mr president million americans file for unemployment last week we haven ’ t hear you talk a lot today about what they ’ re go through so what ’ s — the president oh i think it ’ s — — your message to them and — the president i think they ’ re go through i think it ’ s terrible so look four weeks ago we have the greatest economy in the history of the world the greatest in the world — greatest in the history of the world we have the most job ever in the history of the unite state almost million job right and then one day i get a call from deborah who ’ s fantastic and from dr fauci and he say and she say “ we have a problem i say “ what ’ s the problem and they say “ we may have to close it up i say “ close what up they say “ close up the country and i say “ what ’ s that all about and we discuss today — and probably not since we come to that conclusion — and she be a fantastic person a brilliant person and this be what she know i say “ have it ever be this bad and i think i can represent that you say “ no and part of it — it ’ s a contagion it ’ s so contagious it ’ s like if you sneeze i probably get it whoever hear of a thing like that okay and this very talented reporter be bail out okay he ’ s out of here i don ’ t blame you but it ’ s a very contagious thing and — probably the like of which we ’ ve never see in term of that but — so that ’ s over years ago but that be — you know it ’ s be write about many many time that be a horrible — whether it be or million people — i ’ ve hear from to i ’ ve hear to — but it be tens of millions of people now we have the advantage of communication this could have be just as bad i mean here we can read on the internet we can see what to do we can have these meet they can watch on television which they do a lot of people be watch a lot of people be watch and they say “ gee social distance ” but in they didn ’ t have that option you know they didn ’ t know what to do they just notice people be die all over the place think of it to million people die a lot of people in this country die i always — to me it ’ s a great — it ’ s a great question how come more people didn ’ t die in this country and they say it actually start in this country and go to europe i mean we lose a lot of people but relatively we lose very few compare to europe so this be a terrible thing that happen and what ’ s happen now with people and job — so think of the position i ’ m in we have build all together everybody — not me everybody — the greatest economy in history and all of a sudden people come in that we respect and we know and here ’ s the thing they be right everybody question it for a while not everybody but a good portion question it they say “ let ’ s keep it open let ’ s ride it if we do that — you saw the other graph and whether it ’ s true or almost true or maybe not true enough — the number be million people would have die million people would have die in a short period of time in fact the graph could have be even shorter i always notice that that horrible one — where it go high — it actually come down a little bite faster it might have be over faster and you would have lose million people so they come in and they say “ we have to close up the country and i say “ you know what that do to this — to the fabric of this country to people that have great job great family no problems with money their — everything be perfect then all of a sudden they go from that to have no job in one day they never even think of it and then you see million people unemployed unemployment number get release and you see million people and it ’ s an artificial close it ’ s not like we have a massive recession or worse it ’ s artificial because we turn it off think of all we ’ re do we ’ re say “ don ’ t go to work and we ’ ll pay you everything be the opposite it be always “ go to work and make a lot of money and do well and — the american dream because of a hide enemy we ’ re say “ don ’ t go to work and we ’ re go to pay you ” look at the money trillion and we will probably do more i think infrastructure would be a fantastic thing to do you want to get the restaurants back you give deductibility you understand what that be you give deductibility for businesses where they go and they use the restaurants the restaurants will be bigger and better than they be before you know people don ’ t know a lot of restaurants close when they end deductibility and then they start do well but they have fewer restaurants but the boom of the restaurants be when they have deductibility where corporations could use them so — and entertainment that be a great thing but they close it and then they close it again and it wasn ’ t the same but if you want to get them back you do that but infrastructure we borrow our money now at zero you know if be pay percent percent percent it ’ s a different ballgame we ’ re borrow — we can borrow long term for zero — literally zero you know that — because we ’ re consider the safe investment all over the world they want money in the unite state that ’ s where they want the money so i know better than anybody i just — i know what they ’ re go through and it ’ s horrible but you know what i want to do i want to be able to get them back fast when this be over it ’ s go to be a day we ’ re go to celebrate because everyone be go to go to work and i think we ’ re go to have boom time i think it ’ s go to be great and we ’ ve learn a lot we ’ ve learn about border we ’ ve learn about reliance on other countries we ’ ve learn so much — so much that i think we really have a chance to be bigger and better and stronger and i think it ’ s go to come back very quickly but first we have to defeat this enemy so we will see you tomorrow thank you very much thank you end pm edt   \n",

      "4  gentile presidente onorevoli senatrici onorevoli senatori l’odierna informativa mi consente di offrire al parlamento un quadro compiuto delle più recenti iniziative che il governo ha adottato sul piano interno e un aggiornamento sulle iniziative che a livello europeo sono in programma per fronteggiare l’emergenza epidemiologica da  questo passaggio viene compiuto nella chiara consapevolezza  di chi vi parla ma anche dell’intero governo  della necessità di coinvolgere appieno il parlamento in particolare in una fase in cui l’azione del governo per il carattere straordinario e la portata pervasiva dell’emergenza che stiamo affrontando rileva direttamente su beni primari della persona la salute la libertà l’iniziativa economica il lavoro a tacer d’altre veniamo alle iniziative adottate sul piano interno sulla legittimità e sulla ragionevolezza degli strumenti ai quali si è fatto ricorso come sapete è in atto un ampio dibattito molto articolato che riflette un variegato panorama di posizioni non entro evidentemente in questa discussione anche se non rimango affatto indifferente a tutte le questioni da essa sollevate desidero tuttavia ribadire qui proprio in quest’aula che la pandemia ha costretto a misure di estrema urgenza adottate sempre nel rispetto dei principi di massima precauzione e di proporzionalità in ogni più delicato passaggio ho sempre avuto la massima premura affinché fosse preservato il delicato complesso equilibrio fra i molteplici valori coinvolti tutti tutti di rango costituzionale e affinché fosse assicurato che i diversi organi costituzionali ciascuno espressione di irrinunciabili garanzie fossero coinvolti nella misura più ampia possibile soprattutto a tutela del principio supremo di democraticità che informa di sé l’intero ordinamento giuridico sotto il profilo della risposta sanitaria all’emergenza il governo ha elaborato in queste ultime settimane in particolare una strategia e su questa vi informiamo che possiamo sintetizzare in cinque punti  mantenere e far rispettare a tutti i livelli le misure per il distanziamento sociale e promuovere l’utilizzo diffuso dei dispositivi di protezione individuale fino a quando non saranno disponibili una specifica terapia e un vaccino rafforzare le reti sanitarie del territorio come arma principale per combattere il virus a questo riguardo il governo si sta adoperando perché siano rafforzati tutti i servizi di prevenzione e sta sollecitando una rinnovata integrazione tra le politiche sanitarie e quelle sociali con particolare attenzione a case di cura e residenze sanitarie assistenziali ove si è verificata purtroppo un’esplosione incontrollata dei contagi specialmente in alcune aree del paese intensificare in tutto il territorio la presenza di “covid hospital” come strumento fondamentale della gestione ospedaliera dei pazienti la presenza di strutture dedicate esclusivamente al  riduce notevolmente il rischio di contagio per gli operatori sanitari ma anche per i pazienti che sono ricoverati per altre malattie uso corretto dei test sia di quelli molecolari banalmente tampone che oggi sono l’unico strumento certo di identificazione del virus sia di quelli sierologici ad esempio l’analisi del sangue utile strumento di indagine e conoscenza epidemiologica anche al fine di predisporre un piano nazionale che potrà fotografare efficacemente lo stato epidemiologico del nostro paese al riguardo il  aprile è stata indetta dal commissario arcuri su richiesta del ministero della salute una gara in procedura semplificata e di massima urgenza per la fornitura di kit reagenti e consumabili per l’effettuazione di  test finalizzati ad un’indagine campione sulla diffusione dell’infezione nella popolazione italiana con possibile successiva estensione per l’effettuazione di ulteriori  test la gara pubblica si concluderà in tempi strettissimi entro il  aprile ci sarà ragionevolmente la sottoscrizione del contratto all’esito di una procedura trasparente e rigorosa rafforzamento della strategia di mappatura dei contatti sospetti ormai l’espressione è di uso comune contact tracing e di teleassistenza con l’utilizzo delle nuove tecnologie l’immediatezza nella individuazione dei contatti stretti dei casi positivi e il loro conseguente isolamento sono cruciali per evitare che singoli contagiati possano determinare nuovi focolai per questo un’adeguata applicazione informativa direttamente disponibile su smartphone è uno strumento essenziale per accelerare questo processo attenzione però questa applicazione lo dico chiaramente sarà offerta su base volontaria e non su base obbligatoria e faremo in modo che chi non vorrà scaricarla non subirà limitazione nei movimenti o altri pregiudizi  un team composto dal ministero dell’innovazione dal ministero della salute e da esperti in sicurezza cibernetica sta affiancando il commissario arcuri al fine di implementare questa applicazione nel migliore dei modi e con le più elevate garanzie ho dato indicazioni affinché i capigruppo di maggioranza ma anche di minoranza siano costantemente informati su questo processo applicativo io stesso mi riservo in una fase più avanzata di riferire puntualmente alle camere sui dettagli di questa applicazione nella consapevolezza che il coinvolgimento del parlamento deve essere pieno e stringente essendo coinvolti diritti costituzionali fondamentali penso alla dignità della persona penso al diritto alla riservatezza e all’identità personale come pure la tutela della salute pubblica e non ultima l’esigenza di proteggere un asset informativo di primaria importanza nella logica degli interessi strategici nazionali per quanto concerne la distribuzione di dispositivi sanitari e di protezione personale comunico che tramite il sistema “ada  analisi distribuzione aiuti” aggiornato in tempo reale sono disponibili sui vari siti ufficiali del govern  informazioni puntuali su dispositivi apparecchiature e distribuzione che ogni giorno il commissario arcuri invia alle regioni e alla province autonome per fronteggiare l’emergenza vi fornisco solo qualche dato riassuntivo per comprendere lo sforzo compiuto in un periodo in cui vi è una forsennata competizione di buona parte dei paesi ad accaparrarsi questi materiali\\r al  aprile risultano distribuiti alle regioni dalla protezione civile circa  ventilatori per le terapie  mila tubi endotracheali  milioni di mascherine di varie tipologie con riguardo invece alle più generali misure contenitive adottate dal governo fin dall’inizio dell’emergenza e sulle quali ho riferito diffusamente nell’informativa precedente che risale al  marzo scorso ricordo che in queste ultime settimane sono stati adottati due ulteriori decreti del presidente del consiglio dei ministri entrambi volti sostanzialmente a prorogare il regime restrittivo già in vigore con il dpcm del ° aprile è stata prorogata fino al  aprile  l’efficacia delle disposizioni dei decreti del presidente del consiglio dell’ del  dell’ e del  marzo nonché l’efficacia delle disposizioni previste in varie ordinanze ministeriali \\r si tratta come è noto delle misure riguardanti il distanziamento sociale il divieto di spostamenti salvo comprovate esigenze la chiusura delle scuole e di altri luoghi di aggregazione la sospensione delle attività produttive industriali e commerciali ad eccezione di quelle che erogano servizi di pubblica utilità o servizi pubblici essenziali successivamente il  aprile quelle stesse misure sempre con dpcm sono state prorogate quindi veniamo al sistema di disciplina vigente sino al  maggio \\r la decisione di prorogare ulteriormente quello che è comunemente omai denominato come lockdown è stata assunta alla luce dei dati epidemiologici delle ultime settimane con particolare riguardo all’andamento dei contagi questi dati hanno confermato l’efficacia delle misure di contenimento adottate ma contestualmente hanno suggerito l’esigenza di perseguire con immutato rigore lungo il percorso intrapreso affinché i risultati conseguiti non andassero perduti \\r si prospetta adesso davanti a noi una fase molto complessa dobbiamo procedere a un allentamento del regime attuale delle restrizioni che riguardano le attività produttive e commerciali dobbiamo fare il possibile evidentemente per preservare l’integrità l’efficienza del nostro tessuto produttivo i motori del paese devono riavviarsi ma questo riavvio deve avvenire sulla base di un piano ben strutturato articolato che comporti una revisione dei modelli organizzativi di lavoro delle modalità del trasporto pubblico ma anche privato e di tutte le attività connesse \\r anche per le misure di distanziamento sociale ci saranno alcune modifiche non mi sfugge non ci sfugge a tutti la difficoltà per i cittadini di continuare a osservare regole fortemente limitative della loro libertà di movimento che hanno implicato una profonda modifica delle nostre abitudini di vita il ritorno alla normalità seppure con la gradualità necessaria è un’aspirazione comprensibile di tutti \\r tutte queste esigenze mi vengono rappresentate dai medesimi cittadini ma mi vengono sollecitate anche da molti di voi parlamentari che – nel momento in cui vi fate interpreti delle istanze provenienti dai territori dai diversi mondi  mi avete scritto sollecitando soluzioni rapide soluzioni sostenibili e vi ringrazio di questo anche per questo reputo doveroso informare il parlamento circa la strategia che il governo sta elaborando proprio in questi giorni allo scopo di procedere a un progressivo ma ordinato allentamento delle misure \\r per questa finalità con specifico dpcm sempre il  aprile ho istituito un comitato di esperti in materia economica e sociale con il compito di elaborare proposte utili per orientare il governo nelle decisioni che dovrà assumere al riguardo questo comitato di esperti sta agendo di concerto con il comitato tecnicoscientifico affinché le strategie individuate per la ripartenza economica si basino su imprescindibili precondizioni di sicurezza sono membri di diritto di questo comitato di esperti anche il dott borrelli capo della protezione civile e il commissario straordinario dott arcuri in modo da ottenere il pieno coordinamento tra gli organi che ci coadiuvano in questa durissima sfida \\r con l’ausilio di questi esperti stiamo elaborando un programma di progressive aperture che sia omogeneo su base nazionale e che ci consenta di riaprire buona parte delle attività produttive e anche commerciali tenendo però sotto controllo la curva del contagio questo è molto importante dobbiamo tenere sotto controllo la curva del contagio in modo da intervenire se è del caso anche successivamente laddove questa si rinnalzi oltre una certa soglia soglia che non pensiamo debba essere formulata in termini meramente astratti ma che vogliamo commisurata alla specifica recettività delle strutture ospedaliere dell’area di riferimento \\r ovviamente per poter riprendere in sicurezza le attività economiche dovrà essere garantito il rispetto dei protocolli a partire da quello firmato il  marzo scorso con i sindacati e le categorie produttive e successivamente aggiornato \\r una volta completato questo programma lo discuteremo con tutti i soggetti coinvolti quindi anche enti territoriali organizzazioni datoriali sindacati al fine di acquisire le valutazioni e di condividerlo con tutti i soggetti interessati si tratta  lo ripeto  di uno dei passaggi più sensibili e più complessi \\r siamo consapevoli infatti che un’imprudenza commessa in questa fase un’avventatezza in questa fase dettata semmai dalla legittima aspettativa di ripartire può  in un momento in cui ancora non è esaurita ma solo contenuta la carica del contagio – compromettere tutti i sacrifici che con responsabilità e disciplina i cittadini hanno dovuto affrontare sin qui \\r veniamo al sostegno all’economia lo scorso  aprile è stato approvato il decretolegge n  del  attualmente all’esame della camera dei deputati per la sua conversione in legge in cui diventano operative nuove misure a supporto di imprese artigiani autonomi e professionisti \\r il provvedimento prosegue e amplia lo spettro di interventi disposti nel decretolegge cd “cura italia” ed è incentrato su tre principali direttive a misure di sostegno alla liquidità delle imprese volte a sbloccare ulteriori flussi di finanziamento garantiti a beneficio del sistema produttivo b misure di tutela degli asset strategici nazionali c misure fiscali volte a prorogare le scadenze esistenti e a incentivare le spese sostenute dalle imprese per riaprire in sicurezza \\r sostenere l’erogazione agevolata di liquidità alle imprese grazie alle garanzie pubbliche aiuta a prevenire fenomeni di interruzione del credito e del circuito dei pagamenti che rischia di compromettere la continuità delle attività economiche \\r inoltre per evitare il rischio di una perdita permanente di capacità produttiva e di crescita potenziale del nostro paese è fondamentale accrescere la protezione del nostro tessuto industriale per questa ragione nel decretolegge avete trovato anche nuove misure a tutela degli asset strategici italiani abbiamo esteso l’applicativo della golden power a nuovi settori che non erano ricompresi e consideriamo anch’essi di rilevanza strategica abbiamo anche esteso la sua applicazione a operazioni infraeuropee che sino che sino a adesso rimanevano escluse \\r questa emergenza sta incidendo sulle fasce più fragili della popolazione e rischia di creare nuove povertà quindi non possiamo ignorare questo fenomeno che rischia di lacerare un tessuto sociale già provato abbiamo compiuto alcuni primi passi per venire incontro alle urgenze dei cittadini che versano in condizioni di maggiore difficoltà \\r ricordate il decreto dpcm del  marzo con cui il governo ha anticipato ai comuni una quota del  delle erogazioni previste dal fondo di solidarietà comunale pari a  miliardi di euro che potranno essere utilizzati anche a ulteriore garanzia della piena funzionalità dei servizi pubblici erogati inoltre con un’ordinanza della protezione civile del  marzo  sono stati anticipati  milioni di euro ai comuni italiani per consentire loro di distribuire aiuti alimentari ai cittadini più bisognosi sotto forma di buoni spesa o in alternativa di generi alimentari e di prima necessità consegnati in via diretta \\r il governo però è consapevole che questi interventi non sono sufficienti e occorre un sostegno alle famiglie e alle imprese prolungato nel tempo ancora più incisivo la recessione indotta dalle necessarie misure di contenimento del virus infatti avrà un impatto profondo e persistente sull’intera economia le recenti previsioni del fondo monetario internazionale stimano una caduta del prodotto interno lordo del  per il  a cui seguirebbe poi una crescita del  nel  ecco di fronte a questo quadro dobbiamo potenziare ulteriormente la nostra risposta di politica economica  per tale ragione in aggiunta ai  miliardi di euro già stanziati con il cosiddetto decretolegge “cura italia” il governo invierà a brevissimo al parlamento un’ulteriore relazione contenente una richiesta di scostamento dagli obiettivi di bilancio precedenti per il  pari a una cifra ben superiore a quella stanziata a marzo una cifra davvero consistente non inferiore a  miliardi di euro che si aggiungeranno ai  miliardi già stanziati per un intervento complessivo non inferiore a  miliardi questo ulteriore ricorso al disavanzo servirà a finanziare varie misure destinate tra le altre al rafforzamento del personale sanitario della protezione civile e delle forze di sicurezza alla proroga e al rafforzamento degli ammortizzatori sociali in particolare la cassa integrazione e indennizzi per gli autonomi e le partite iva al sostegno di coloro che non sono coperti da cassa integrazione a misure di sostegno alle piccole e medie imprese a fondi aggiuntivi per comuni province città metropolitane e regioni agli interventi di sostegno dei settori particolarmente colpiti dalle misure di contenimento del virus sono consapevole che l’iter di conversione in legge dei decretilegge finora adottati ha lasciato parzialmente insoddisfatte le legittime aspettative delle forze politiche di poter contribuire con proprie proposte alla definizione del quadro degli interventi ringrazio sentitamente i gruppi parlamentari per la consapevolezza mostrata del contesto particolarmente critico nel quale in ragione dell’emergenza siamo costretti a operare assicuro che nella costruzione dell’ampio corpus di misure che troveranno collocazione nel prossimo decretolegge al quale ho fatto cenno sarà assicurata la massima attenzione alle istanze e alle proposte dei parlamentari anche in conformità agli impegni assunti dal governo e formalizzati in specifici ordini del giorno accolti in sede di esame parlamentare del decretolegge “cura italia” ringrazio in particolare la maggioranza che sostiene il governo i presidenti dei gruppi in primo luogo ma anche se mi permettete ogni singolo parlamentare per l’impegno la partecipazione l’apporto costruttivo anche quando critico per il sostegno che non state facendo mai mancare e in un momento così difficile per la vita della nazione desidero confermare la piena disponibilità al dialogo mia e dell’intero governo con le forze di opposizione il contributo di una opposizione responsabile e consapevole della gravità dell’ora troverà sempre apertura e considerazione la sfida che ci attende tuttavia non può essere affrontata efficacemente ricorrendo soltanto a politiche nazionali visto che il virus non conosce confini e sta pervasivamente incidendo sui tessuti economicosociali di molti paesi affinché tutti i paesi possano superare l’emergenza sanitaria ricostruire la propria società e la propria economia è necessario che le nazioni sappiano mettere in campo una risposta coordinata solidale l’ho ribadito in tutte le opportune sedi istituzionali – a livello di   consiglio europeo  l’unione europea e l’eurozona non possono permettersi di ripetere gli errori commessi durante la crisi finanziaria del  allora non si riuscì ad affrontare in modo coordinato unito e solidale uno shock comune si decise addirittura un consolidamento fiscale affrettato e ingiustificato che amplificando le divergenze fra i paesi produsse un secondo shock di natura asimmetrica nel  portando  come sappiamo e ricordiamo – alla crisi dei debiti sovrani condannando l’europa a una recessione più prolungata e a una ripresa più lenta e più debole rispetto alle altre maggiori aree economiche del mondo è un rischio che adesso non ci possiamo permettere di correre poiché il fallimento nel produrre una risposta adeguata e coraggiosa porterebbe  inevitabilmente – grave danno allo stesso progetto europeo  l’eurogruppo dello scorso  aprile ha preparato un rapporto per la risposta economica dell’unione all’emergenza sanitaria ed economica che oltre a tenere conto dei progressi compiuti predispone un pacchetto di strumenti a disposizione degli stati membri composto da quattro elementi principali innanzitutto viene costituito un fondo di garanzia europeo presso la banca europea degli investimenti la bei dotato di  miliardi di euro che dovrebbe consentire l’attivazione fino a  miliardi di euro di finanziamenti per gli investimenti all’interno dell’unione il secondo elemento del pacchetto è il cosiddetto piano “sure” uno strumento di assistenza finanziaria che potrà erogare fino a  miliardi in linee di credito dedicate alle misure di sostegno al reddito dei lavoratori temporaneamente privi di impiego questi due elementi seppure ancora insufficienti già si caratterizzano per un finanziamento con garanzie comuni e quindi a tassi di interesse bassi per spese e investimenti da effettuare nei paesi membri sul terzo elemento del pacchetto ovvero l’attivazione di una linea di credito dedicata alle spese sanitarie ed erogata dal meccanismo europeo di stabilità l’ormai strafamoso mes si è alimentato nelle ultime settimane un dibattito che rischia di dividere l’italia in opposte tifoserie l’europa non deve ritrovarsi nuovamente a chiedere scusa nei confronti di nessun paese come è successo in passato quando ha imposto alla grecia programmi particolarmente severi di qui la mia posizione di assoluta cautela di fronte alla sfida epocale che abbiamo di fronte non si può pensare che la risposta possa essere affidata a interventi modesti peraltro sul piano finanziario e per di più basati su un accordo intergovernativo come il mes pensato per gestire crisi assai diverse riguardanti singoli paesi imputabili a squilibri di natura economica per questo è stato concepito in virtù di decisione prese nel passato per come è stato concepito è uno strumento che ha sin qui espresso linee di finanziamento caratterizzate da forti condizionalità macroeconomiche e che per di più ha consentito di dosare l’imposizione di misure fiscali al soggetto finanziato via via sempre più stringenti tutte cose che io ritengo inaccettabili data la natura di questa crisi  insieme ad altri otto paesi membri l’italia ha lanciato una sfida ambiziosa all’europa invitandola a introdurre nuovi strumenti per affrontare e superare al più presto questa crisi alcuni di questi paesi che hanno condiviso questa nostra impostazione hanno dichiarato da subito – e voglio anche dirlo esplicitamente la spagna  di essere interessati al mes purché non abbia le rigide condizionalità applicate in altre circostanze ma solo la condizione che l’utilizzo del finanziamento sia per far fronte alle spese sanitarie dirette o indirette che siano rifiutare la nuova linea di credito significherebbe fare un torto ai paesi che pure sono a noi affiancati in questa battaglia e che intendono invece usufruirne resto però convinto che all’italia serva altro all’ultima riunione dell’eurogruppo è stato compiuto un deciso passo avanti in questa nuova direzione nel paragrafo  relativo all’utilizzo del mes è stata proposta come sapete una nuova linea di credito chiamata “pandemic crisis support” e adattata alla natura simmetrica dello shock legato al  soggetta alla sola condizione dell’utilizzo del finanziamento per le spese sanitarie e di prevenzione dirette e indirette per capire se effettivamente sarà così bisognerà però attendere l’elaborazione dei vari documenti relativi ai termini di finanziamento che verranno predisposti per erogare questa nuova linea di credito su questo versante mi attendo ulteriori peraltro chiare prese di posizione anche in seno al consiglio europeo e in ogni caso siamo disponibili a lavorare con i paesi direttamente interessati a questa nuova linea di credito affinché anche in sede regolamentare comunque non siano introdotte condizionalità di sorta macroeconomiche o anche più specifiche quanti oggi esprimono dubbi e perplessità su questa nuova linea di credito a mio avviso a mio personale avviso contribuiscono a un dibattito democratico e costruttivo e sono io il primo a dire che bisognerà valutare attentamente i dettagli dell’accordo \\r solo allora potremo valutare in via conclusiva se questa nuova linea di credito pone condizioni quali condizioni pone e solo allora potremo discutere se il relativo regolamento può essere o meno conforme all’interesse nazionale se può essere o meno conveniente e opportuno rispetto agli interessi nazionali\\r ho già dichiarato in altre sedi ritengo che questa discussione in un paese civile e democratico debba avvenire in modo pubblico e trasparente dinanzi al parlamento al quale spetterà l’ultima parola ma la verità è che la trattativa in cui siamo impegnati in europa è particolarmente complessa perché la risposta comune non può poggiare solo su queste misure deve essere ben più efficace ben più consistente\\r noi siamo ben convinti della forza delle nostre ragioni\\r all’inizio eravamo soli nelle scorse settimane ho però proposto una lettera un vero e proprio manifesto programmatico che è stato sottoscritto da altri  paesi che ora sono con noi a chiedere strumenti nuovi adatti alla situazione eccezionale che stiamo vivendo\\r \\r il quarto elemento del pacchetto è un pezzo fondamentale della nostra strategia europea uno european recovery fund che possa finanziare progetti comuni di interesse europeo per avviare un piano di ricostruzione fondato sugli investimenti l’innovazione la sostenibilità ambientale la tutela della salute e dell’ambiente\\r il rapporto dell’eurogruppo dello scorso  aprile richiama la necessità di costruire questo strumento che l’italia intende realizzare quanto più velocemente possibile strutturandolo come un veicolo in grado di finanziarsi con debito comune sui mercati finanziari\\r sarà  questo  il tema della riunione della videoconferenza dei membri del consiglio europeo prevista per il prossimo giovedì  aprile\\r l’italia insieme agli altri paesi che condividono questa medesima strategia sostiene la necessità di una risposta coordinata e ambiziosa allo shock da  con la conseguenza che questo nuovo strumento di finanziamento dovrà    essere conforme ai trattati europei perché non abbiamo il tempo di operare modifiche che comporterebbero una lunga e complessa procedura  gestito a livello europeo e offerto a tutti i paesi interessati senza che possa assumere un carattere bilaterale  dovrà essere particolarmente consistente quanto alla dimensione finanziaria ben più consistente degli strumenti di cui attualmente si parla  dovrà essere mirato a far fronte a tutte le conseguenze negative economiche e sociali prodotte dal   dovrà essere immediatamente disponibile e se pure verrà a ricadere sul nuovo quadro finanziario pluriennale dovrà essere messo a disposizione di tutti i paesi interessati subito è possibile farlo tecnicamente attraverso un meccanismo di garanzie che ne anticipino l’applicazione cd bridge  non dovrà avere le condizionalità infine penso anche in termini di cofinanziamento di modalità di spesa che caratterizzano gli ordinari piani di finanziamento strutturali dell’unione europea  al momento abbiamo un’iniziativa della presidente della commissione europea ursula von der leyen che per quanto da essa stessa mi è stato specificamente anticipato potrebbe avere queste caratteristiche e muovere proprio in questa direzione\\r sul tavolo vi è anche una proposta francese se ne è parlato anche nei giornali che legherebbe il recovery fund a un veicolo costruito ad hoc in grado di emettere strumenti di debito comune e di erogare fondi ai paesi membri noi appoggiamo questa proposta francese avendo chiesto di integrarla rispetto alla sua originaria formulazione in modo da rispondere più puntualmente e ampiamente ai requisiti che ho indicato e che riteniamo imprescindibili\\r da ultimo forse avete anche avuto notizia di questo è stata presentata una proposta spagnola che pure ma con qualche suggerimento di variazione potremmo appoggiare per la conformità alle caratteristiche e alle finalità che ho più sopra indicate\\r ai paesi che condividono con noi la medesima linea di intervento abbiamo riservatamente anticipato anche una nostra proposta sempre in questa direzione che riteniamo pienamente conforme ad esempio all’art  del trattato ma a noi interessa portare a casa un risultato non interessa in questo momento rivendicare una primazia in questo momento riteniamo opportuno condividere quanto più possibile le proposte sul tavolo senza rischiare di dividerci con la conseguenza di rallentare non ce lo possiamo permettere il processo decisionale europeo\\r dobbiamo agire presto perché il ritardo comprometterebbe il risultato è un rischio che l’europa non l’italia l’europa non può correre dobbiamo affrettarci senza indugio a rafforzare la nostra casa comune e dobbiamo ripararla in fretta per sperare di competere anche tra le altre cose in modo efficace con le altre economie globali quest’ultimo aspetto vorrei dire non riveste una minore importanza al mantenimento di un equilibrato e sostenibile mercato interno fa evidentemente da corollario nell’azione esterna dell’unione europea quel “level playing field” quella parità di condizioni che le consentirebbe di restare al passo con i grandi players globali\\r le consultazioni e concludo da me avute in questi giorni sia a livello  che  hanno fatto da subito emergere  cosa che non smetto mai di segnalare ai miei omologhi  la magnitudo dello spazio fiscale messo in campo pensate da usa dalla cina e dallo stesso giappone\\r di fronte a ordini di grandezza di diversi trilioni di dollari la risposta complessiva europea non si è ancora configurata di livello adeguato\\r è per questa ragione che non potrò accettare un compromesso al ribasso qui non siamo di fronte a un negoziato a somma zero non ci saranno alcuni vincitori e alcuni perdenti sono intimamente convinto parlando di europa che o vinceremo tutti o perderemo tutti il prossimo incontro europeo a livello di leader dei  stati membri dell’unione europea non ritengo sarà quello risolutivo a questo fine ma farò di tutto perché esprima già il prossimo consiglio europeo un indirizzo politico chiaro nell’unica direzione che vi ho espresso l’unica

      "4  gentile presidente onorevoli senatrici onorevoli senatori l ’ odierna informativa mi consente di offrire al parlamento un quadro compiuto delle più recenti iniziative che il governo ha adottato sul piano interno e un aggiornamento sulle iniziative che a livello europeo sono in programma per fronteggiare l ’ emergenza epidemiologica da questo passaggio viene compiuto nella chiara consapevolezza di chi vi parla ma anche dell ’ intero governo della necessità di coinvolgere appieno il parlamento in particolare in una fase in cui l ’ azione del governo per il carattere straordinario e la portata pervasiva dell ’ emergenza che stiamo affrontando rileva direttamente su beni primari della persona la salute la libertà l ’ iniziativa economica il lavoro a tacer d ’ altre veniamo alle iniziative adottate sul piano interno sulla legittimità e sulla ragionevolezza degli strumenti ai quali si è fatto ricorso come sapete è in atto un ampio dibattito molto articolato che riflette un variegato panorama di posizioni non entro evidentemente in questa discussione anche se non rimango affatto indifferente a tutte le questioni da essa sollevate desidero tuttavia ribadire qui proprio in quest ’ aula che la pandemia ha costretto a misure di estrema urgenza adottate sempre nel rispetto dei principi di massima precauzione e di proporzionalità in ogni più delicato passaggio ho sempre avuto la massima premura affinché fosse preservato il delicato complesso equilibrio fra i molteplici valori coinvolti tutti tutti di rango costituzionale e affinché fosse assicurato che i diversi organi costituzionali ciascuno espressione di irrinunciabili garanzie fossero coinvolti nella misura più ampia possibile soprattutto a tutela del principio supremo di democraticità che informa di sé l ’ intero ordinamento giuridico sotto il profilo della risposta sanitarium all ’ emergenza il governo ha elaborato in queste ultime settimane in particolare una strategia e su questa vi informiamo che possiamo sintetizzare in cinque punti mantenere e far rispettare a tutti i livelli le misure per il distanziamento sociale e promuovere l ’ utilizzo diffuso dei dispositivi di protezione individuale fino a quando non saranno disponibili una specifica terapia e un vaccino rafforzare le reti sanitarie del territorio come arma principale per combattere il virus a questo riguardo il governo si sta adoperando perché siano rafforzati tutti i servizi di prevenzione e sta sollecitando una rinnovata integrazione tra le politiche sanitarie e quelle sociali con particolare attenzione a case di cura e residenze sanitarie assistenziali ove si è verificata purtroppo un ’ esplosione incontrollata dei contagi specialmente in alcune aree del paese intensificare in tutto il territorio la presenza di “ covid hospital ” come strumento fondamentale della gestione ospedaliera dei pazienti la presenza di strutture dedicate esclusivamente al riduce notevolmente il rischio di contagio per gli operatori sanitari ma anche per i pazienti che sono ricoverati per altre malattie uso corretto dei test sia di quelli molecolari banalmente tampone che oggi sono l ’ unico strumento certo di identificazione del virus sia di quelli sierologici ad esempio l ’ analisi del sangue utile strumento di indagine e conoscenza epidemiologica anche al fine di predisporre un piano nazionale che potrà fotografare efficacemente lo stato epidemiologico del nostro paese al riguardo il aprile è stata indetta dal commissario arcuri su richiesta del ministero della salute una gara in procedura semplificata e di massima urgenza per la fornitura di kit reagenti e consumabili per l ’ effettuazione di test finalizzati ad un ’ indagine campione sulla diffusione dell ’ infezione nella popolazione italiana con possibile successiva estensione per l ’ effettuazione di ulteriori test la gara pubblica si concluderà in tempo strettissimi entro il aprile ci sarà ragionevolmente la sottoscrizione del contratto all ’ esito di una procedura trasparente e rigorosa rafforzamento della strategia di mappatura dei contatti sospetti ormai l ’ espressione è di uso comune contact tracing e di teleassistenza con l ’ utilizzo delle nuove tecnologie l ’ immediatezza nella individuazione dei contatti stretti dei casi positivi e il loro conseguente isolamento sono cruciali per evitare che singoli contagiati possano determinare nuovi focolai per questo un ’ adeguata applicazione informativa direttamente disponibile su smartphone è uno strumento essenziale per accelerare questo processo attenzione però questa applicazione lo dico chiaramente sarà offerta su base volontaria e non su base obbligatoria e faremo in modo che chi non vorrà scaricarla non subirà limitazione nei movimenti o altri pregiudizi un team composto dal ministero dell ’ innovazione dal ministero della salute e da esperti in sicurezza cibernetica sta affiancando il commissario arcuri al fine di implementare questa applicazione nel migliore dei modi e con le più elevate garanzie ho dato indicazioni affinché i capigruppo di maggioranza ma anche di minoranza siano costantemente informati su questo processo applicativo io stesso mi riservo in una fase più avanzata di riferire puntualmente alle camere sui dettagli di questa applicazione nella consapevolezza che il coinvolgimento del parlamento deve essere pieno e stringente essendo coinvolti diritti costituzionali fondamentali penso alla dignità della persona penso al diritto alla riservatezza e all ’ identità personale come pure la tutela della salute pubblica e non ultima l ’ esigenza di proteggere un asset informativo di primaria importanza nella logica degli interessi strategici nazionali per quanto concerne la distribuzione di dispositivi sanitari e di protezione personale comunico che tramite il sistema “ ada analisi distribuzione aiuti ” aggiornato in tempo reale sono disponibili sui vari siti ufficiali del govern informazioni puntuali su dispositivi apparecchiature e distribuzione che ogni giorno il commissario arcuri invia alle regioni e alla province autonome per fronteggiare l ’ emergenza vi fornisco solo qualche dato riassuntivo per comprendere lo sforzo compiuto in un periodo in cui vi è una forsennata competizione di buona parte dei paesi ad accaparrarsi questi materiali al aprile risultano distribuiti alle regioni dalla protezione civile circa ventilatori per le terapie mila tubi endotracheali milioni di mascherine di varie tipologie con riguardo invece alle più generali misure contenitive adottate dal governo fin dall ’ inizio dell ’ emergenza e sulle quali ho riferito diffusamente nell ’ informativa precedente che risale al marzo scorso ricordo che in queste ultime settimane sono stati adottati due ulteriori decreti del presidente del consiglio dei ministri entrambi volti sostanzialmente a prorogare il regime restrittivo già in vigore con il dpcm del ° aprile è stata prorogata fino al aprile l ’ efficacia delle disposizioni dei decreti del presidente del consiglio dell ’ del dell ’ e del marzo nonché l ’ efficacia delle disposizioni previste in varie ordinanze ministeriali si tratta come è noto delle misure riguardanti il distanziamento sociale il divieto di spostamenti salvo comprovate esigenze la chiusura delle scuole e di altri luoghi di aggregazione la sospensione delle attività produttive industriali e commerciali ad eccezione di quelle che erogano servizi di pubblica utilità o servizi pubblici essenziali successivamente il aprile quelle stesse misure sempre con dpcm sono state prorogate quindi veniamo al sistema di disciplina vigente sino al maggio la decisione di prorogare ulteriormente quello che è comunemente omai denominato come lockdown è stata assunta alla luce dei dati epidemiologici delle ultime settimane con particolare riguardo all ’ andamento dei contagi questi dati hanno confermato l ’ efficacia delle misure di contenimento adottate ma contestualmente hanno suggerito l ’ esigenza di perseguire con immutato rigore lungo il percorso intrapreso affinché i risultati conseguiti non andassero perduti si prospetta adesso davanti a noi una fase molto complessa dobbiamo procedere a un allentamento del regime attuale delle restrizioni che riguardano le attività produttive e commerciali dobbiamo fare il possibile evidentemente per preservare l ’ integrità l ’ efficienza del nostro tessuto produttivo i motori del paese devono riavviarsi ma questo riavvio deve avvenire sulla base di un piano ben strutturato articolato che comporti una revisione dei modelli organizzativi di lavoro delle modalità del trasporto pubblico ma anche privato e di tutte le attività connesse anche per le misure di distanziamento sociale ci saranno alcune modifiche non mi sfugge non ci sfugge a tutti la difficoltà per i cittadini di continuare a osservare regole fortemente limitative della loro libertà di movimento che hanno implicato una profonda modifica delle nostre abitudini di vita il ritorno alla normalità seppure con la gradualità necessaria è un ’ aspirazione comprensibile di tutti tutte queste esigenze mi vengono rappresentate dai medesimi cittadini ma mi vengono sollecitate anche da molti di voi parlamentari che – nel momento in cui vi fate interpreti delle istanze provenienti dai territori dai diversi mondi mi avete scritto sollecitando soluzioni rapide soluzioni sostenibili e vi ringrazio di questo anche per questo reputo doveroso informare il parlamento circa la strategia che il governo sta elaborando proprio in questi giorni allo scopo di procedere a un progressivo ma ordinato allentamento delle misure per questa finalità con specifico dpcm sempre il aprile ho istituito un comitato di esperti in materia economica e sociale con il compito di elaborare proposte utili per orientare il governo nelle decisioni che dovrà assumere al riguardo questo comitato di esperti sta agendo di concerto con il comitato tecnicoscientifico affinché le strategie individuate per la ripartenza economica si basino su imprescindibili precondizioni di sicurezza sono membri di diritto di questo comitato di esperti anche il dott borrelli capo della protezione civile e il commissario straordinario dott arcuri in modo da ottenere il pieno coordinamento tra gli organi che ci coadiuvano in questa durissima sfida con l ’ ausilio di questi esperti stiamo elaborando un programma di progressive aperture che sia omogeneo su base nazionale e che ci consenta di riaprire buona parte delle attività produttive e anche commerciali tenendo però sotto controllo la curva del contagio questo è molto importante dobbiamo tenere sotto controllo la curva del contagio in modo da intervenire se è del caso anche successivamente laddove questa si rinnalzi oltre una certa soglia soglia che non pensiamo debba essere formulata in terminus meramente astratti ma che vogliamo commisurata alla specifica recettività delle strutture ospedaliere dell ’ area di riferimento ovviamente per poter riprendere in sicurezza le attività economiche dovrà essere garantito il rispetto dei protocolli a partire da quello firmato il marzo scorso con i sindacati e le categorie produttive e successivamente aggiornato una volta completato questo programma lo discuteremo con tutti i soggetti coinvolti quindi anche enti territoriali organizzazioni datoriali sindacati al fine di acquisire le valutazioni e di condividerlo con tutti i soggetti interessati si tratta lo ripeto di uno dei passaggi più sensibili e più complessi siamo consapevoli infatti che un ’ imprudenza commessa in questa fase un ’ avventatezza in questa fase dettata semmai dalla legittima aspettativa di ripartire può in un momento in cui ancora non è esaurita ma solo contenuta la carica del contagio – compromettere tutti i sacrifici che con responsabilità e disciplina i cittadini hanno dovuto affrontare sin qui veniamo al sostegno all ’ economia lo scorso aprile è stato approvato il decretolegge n del attualmente all ’ esame della camera dei deputati per la sua conversione in legge in cui diventano operative nuove misure a supporto di imprese artigiani autonomi e professionisti il provvedimento prosegue e amplia lo spettro di interventi disposti nel decretolegge cd “ cura italia ” ed è incentrato su tre principali direttive a misure di sostegno alla liquidità delle imprese volta a sbloccare ulteriori flussi di finanziamento garantiti a beneficio del sistema produttivo b misure di tutela degli asset strategici nazionali c misure fiscali volta a prorogare le scadenze esistenti e a incentivare le spese sostenute dalle imprese per riaprire in sicurezza sostenere l ’ erogazione agevolata di liquidità alle imprese grazie alle garanzie pubbliche aiuta a prevenire fenomeni di interruzione del credito e del circuito dei pagamenti che rischia di compromettere la continuità delle attività economiche inoltre per evitare il rischio di una perdita permanente di capacità produttiva e di crescita potenziale del nostro paese è fondamentale accrescere la protezione del nostro tessuto industriale per questa ragione nel decretolegge avete trovato anche nuove misure a tutela degli asset strategici italiani abbiamo esteso l ’ applicativo della golden power a nuovi settori che non erano ricompresi e consideriamo anch ’ essi di rilevanza strategica abbiamo anche esteso la sua applicazione a operazioni infraeuropee che sino che sino a adesso rimanevano escluse questa emergenza sta incidendo sulle fasce più fragili della popolazione e rischia di creare nuove povertà quindi non possiamo ignorare questo fenomeno che rischia di lacerare un tessuto sociale già provato abbiamo compiuto alcuni primo passi per venire incontro alle urgenze dei cittadini che versano in condizioni di maggiore difficoltà ricordate il decreto dpcm del marzo con cui il governo ha anticipato ai comuni una quota del delle erogazioni previste dal fondo di solidarietà comunale pari a miliardi di euro che potranno essere utilizzati anche a ulteriore garanzia della piena funzionalità dei servizi pubblici erogati inoltre con un ’ ordinanza della protezione civile del marzo sono stati anticipati milioni di euro ai comuni italiani per consentire loro di distribuire aiuti alimentari ai cittadini più bisognosi sotto forma di buoni spesa o in alternativa di generi alimentari e di prima necessità consegnati in via diretta il governo però è consapevole che questi interventi non sono sufficienti e occorre un sostegno alle famiglie e alle imprese prolungato nel tempo ancora più incisivo la recessione indotta dalle necessarie misure di contenimento del virus infatti avrà un impatto profondo e persistente sull ’ intera economia le recenti previsioni del fondo monetario internazionale stimano una caduta del prodotto interno lordo del per il a cui seguirebbe poi una crescita del nel ecco di fronte a questo quadro dobbiamo potenziare ulteriormente la nostra risposta di politica economica per tale ragione in aggiunta ai miliardi di euro già stanziati con il cosiddetto decretolegge “ cura italia ” il governo invierà a brevissimo al parlamento un ’ ulteriore relazione contenente una richiesta di scostamento dagli obiettivi di bilancio precedenti per il pari a una cifra ben superiore a quella stanziata a marzo una cifra davvero consistente non inferiore a miliardi di euro che si aggiungeranno ai miliardi già stanziati per un intervento complessivo non inferiore a miliardi questo ulteriore ricorso al disavanzo servirà a finanziare varie misure destinate tra le altre al rafforzamento del personale sanitario della protezione civile e delle forze di sicurezza alla proroga e al rafforzamento degli ammortizzatori sociali in particolare la cassa integrazione e indennizzi per gli autonomi e le partite iva al sostegno di coloro che non sono coperti da cassa integrazione a misure di sostegno alle piccole e medie imprese a fondi aggiuntivi per comuni province città metropolitane e regioni agli interventi di sostegno dei settori particolarmente colpiti dalle misure di contenimento del virus sono consapevole che l ’ iter di conversione in legge dei decretilegge finora adottati ha lasciato parzialmente insoddisfatte le legittime aspettative delle forze politiche di poter contribuire con proprie proposte alla definizione del quadro degli interventi ringrazio sentitamente i gruppi parlamentari per la consapevolezza mostrata del contesto particolarmente critico nel quale in ragione dell ’ emergenza siamo costretti a operare assicuro che nella costruzione dell ’ ampio corpus di misure che troveranno collocazione nel prossimo decretolegge al quale ho fatto cenno sarà assicurata la massima attenzione alle istanze e alle proposte dei parlamentari anche in conformità agli impegni assunti dal governo e formalizzati in specifici ordini del giorno accolti in sede di esame parlamentare del decretolegge “ cura italia ” ringrazio in particolare la maggioranza che sostiene il governo i presidenti dei gruppi in primo luogo ma anche se mi permettete ogni singolo parlamentare per l ’ impegno la partecipazione l ’ apporto costruttivo anche quando critico per il sostegno che non state facendo mai mancare e in un momento così difficile per la vita della nazione desidero confermare la piena disponibilità al dialogo mia e dell ’ intero governo con le forze di opposizione il contributo di una opposizione responsabile e consapevole della gravità dell ’ os troverà sempre apertura e considerazione la sfida che ci attende tuttavia non può essere affrontata efficacemente ricorrendo soltanto a politiche nazionali visto che il virus non conosce confini e sta pervasivamente incidendo sui tessuti economicosociali di molti paesi affinché tutti i paesi possano superare l ’ emergenza sanitarium ricostruire la propria società e la propria economia è necessario che le nazioni sappiano mettere in campo una risposta coordinata solidale l ’ ho ribadito in tutte le opportune sedi istituzionali – a livello di consiglio europeo l ’ unione europea e l ’ eurozona non possono permettersi di ripetere gli errori commessi durante la crisi finanziaria del allora non si riuscì ad affrontare in modo coordinato unito e solidale uno shock comune si decise addirittura un consolidamento fiscale affrettato e ingiustificato che amplificando le divergenze fra i paesi produsse un secondo shock di natura asimmetrica nel portando come sappiamo e ricordiamo – alla crisi dei debiti sovrani condannando l ’ europa a una recessione più prolungata e a una ripresa più lenta e più debole rispetto alle altre maggiori aree economiche del mondo è un rischio che adesso non ci possiamo permettere di correre poiché il fallimento nel produrre una risposta adeguata e coraggiosa porterebbe inevitabilmente – grave danno allo stesso progetto europeo l ’ eurogruppo dello scorso aprile ha preparato un rapporto per la risposta economica dell ’ unione all ’ emergenza sanitarium ed economica che oltre a tenere conto dei progressi compiuti predispone un pacchetto di strumenti a disposizione degli stati membri composto da quattro elementi principali innanzitutto viene costituito un fondo di garanzia europeo presso la banca europea degli investimenti la bei dotato di miliardi di euro che dovrebbe consentire l ’ attivazione fino a miliardi di euro di finanziamenti per gli investimenti all ’ interno dell ’ unione il secondo elemento del pacchetto è il cosiddetto piano “ sure ” uno strumento di assistenza finanziaria che potrà erogare fino a miliardi in linee di credito dedicate alle misure di sostegno al reddito dei lavoratori temporaneamente privi di impiego questi due elementi seppure ancora insufficienti già si caratterizzano per un finanziamento con garanzie comuni e quindi a tassi di interesse basso per spese e investimenti da effettuare nei paesi membri sul terzo elemento del pacchetto ovvero l ’ attivazione di una linea di credito dedicata alle spese sanitarie ed erogata dal meccanismo europeo di stabilità l ’ ormai strafamoso me si è alimentato nelle ultime settimane un dibattito che rischia di dividere l ’ italia in opposte tifoserie l ’ europa non deve ritrovarsi nuovamente a chiedere scusa nei confronti di nessun paese come è successo in passato quando ha imposto alla grecia programmi particolarmente severi di qui la mia posizione di assoluta cautela di fronte alla sfida epocale che abbiamo di fronte non si può pensare che la risposta possa essere affidata a interventi modesti peraltro sul piano finanziario e per di più basati su un accordo intergovernativo come il me pensato per gestire crisi assai diverse riguardanti singoli paesi imputabili a squilibri di natura economica per questo è stato concepito in virtù di decisione prese nel passato per come è stato concepito è uno strumento che ha sin qui espresso linee di finanziamento caratterizzate da forti condizionalità macroeconomiche e che per di più ha consentito di dosare l ’ imposizione di misure fiscali al soggetto finanziato via via sempre più stringenti tutte cose che io ritengo inaccettabili data la natura di questa crisi insieme ad altri otto paesi membri l ’ italia ha lanciato una sfida ambiziosa all ’ europa invitandola a introdurre nuovi strumenti per affrontare e superare al più presto questa crisi alcuni di questi paesi che hanno condiviso questa nostra impostazione hanno dichiarato da subito – e voglio anche dirlo esplicitamente la spagna di essere interessati al me purché non abbia le rigide condizionalità applicate in altre circostanze ma solo la condizione che l ’ utilizzo del finanziamento sia per far fronte alle spese sanitarie dirette o indirette che siano rifiutare la nuova linea di credito significherebbe fare un torto ai paesi che pure sono a noi affiancati in questa battaglia e che intendono invece usufruirne resto però convinto che all ’ italia serva altro all ’ ultima riunione dell ’ eurogruppo è stato compiuto un deciso passo avanti in questa nuova direzione nel paragrafo relativo all ’ utilizzo del me è stata proposta come sapete una nuova linea di credito chiamata “ pandemic crisis support ” e adattata alla natura simmetrica dello shock legato al soggetta alla sola condizione dell ’ utilizzo del finanziamento per le spese sanitarie e di prevenzione dirette e indirette per capire se effettivamente sarà così bisognerà però attendere l ’ elaborazione dei vari documenti relativi ai terminus di finanziamento che verranno predisposti per erogare questa nuova linea di credito su questo versante mi attendo ulteriori peraltro chiare prese di posizione anche in seno al consiglio europeo e in ogni caso siamo disponibili a lavorare con i paesi direttamente interessati a questa nuova linea di credito affinché anche in sede regolamentare comunque non siano introdotte condizionalità di sorta macroeconomiche o anche più specifiche quanti oggi esprimono dubbi e perplessità su questa nuova linea di credito a mio avviso a mio personale avviso contribuiscono a un dibattito democratico e costruttivo e sono io il primo a dire che bisognerà valutare attentamente i dettagli dell ’ accordo solo allora potremo valutare in via conclusiva se questa nuova linea di credito pone condizioni quali condizioni pone e solo allora potremo discutere se il relativo regolamento può essere o meno conforme all ’ interesse nazionale se può essere o meno conveniente e opportuno rispetto agli interessi nazionali ho già dichiarato in altre sedi ritengo che questa discussione in un paese civile e democratico debba avvenire in modo pubblico e trasparente dinanzi al parlamento al quale spetterà l ’ ultima parola ma la verità è che la trattativa in cui siamo impegnati in europa è particolarmente complessa perché la risposta comune non può poggiare solo su queste misure deve essere ben più efficace ben più consistente noi siamo ben convinti della forza delle nostre ragioni all ’ inizio eravamo solo nelle scorse settimane ho però proposto una lettera un vero e proprio manifesto programmatico che è stato sottoscritto da altri paesi che os sono con noi a chiedere strumenti nuovi adatti alla situazione eccezionale che stiamo vivendo il quarto elemento del pacchetto è un pezzo fondamentale della nostra strategia europea uno european recovery fund che possa finanziare progetti comuni di interesse europeo per avviare un piano di ricostruzione fondato sugli investimenti l ’ innovazione la sostenibilità ambientale la tutela della salute e dell ’ ambiente il rapporto dell ’ eurogruppo dello scorso aprile richiama la necessità di costruire questo strumento che l ’ italia intende realizzare quanto più velocemente possibile strutturandolo come un veicolo in grado di finanziarsi con debito comune sui mercati finanziari sarà questo il tema della riunione della videoconferenza dei membri del consiglio europeo prevista per il prossimo giovedì aprile l ’ italia insieme agli altri paesi che condividono questa medesima strategia sostiene la necessità di una risposta coordinata e ambiziosa allo shock da con la conseguenza che questo nuovo strumento di finanziamento dovrà essere conforme ai trattati europei perché non abbiamo il tempo di operare modifiche che comporterebbero una lunga e complessa procedura gestito a livello europeo e offerto a tutti i paesi interessati senza che possa assumere un carattere bilaterale dovrà essere particolarmente consistente quanto alla dimensione finanziaria ben più consistente degli strumenti di cui attualmente si parla dovrà essere mirato a far fronte a tutte le conseguenze negative economiche e sociali prodotte dal dovrà essere immediatamente disponibile e se pure verrà a ricadere sul nuovo quadro finanziario pluriennale dovrà essere messo a disposizione di tutti i paesi interessati subito è possibile farlo tecnicamente attraverso un meccanismo di garanzie che ne anticipino l ’ applicazione cd bridge non dovrà avere le condizionalità infine penso anche in terminus di cofinanziamento di modalità di spesa che caratterizzano gli ordinari piani di finanziamento strutturali dell ’ unione europea al momento abbiamo un ’ iniziativa della presidente della commissione europea ursula von der leyen che per quanto da essa stessa mi è stato specificamente anticipato potrebbe avere queste caratteristiche e muovere proprio in questa direzione sul tavolo vi è anche una proposta francese se ne è parlato anche nei giornali che legherebbe il recovery fund a un veicolo costruito ad hoc in grado di emettere strumenti di debito comune e di erogare fondi ai paesi membri noi appoggiamo questa proposta francese avendo chiesto di integrarla rispetto alla sua originaria formulazione in modo da rispondere più puntualmente e ampiamente ai requisiti che ho indicato e che riteniamo imprescindibili da ultimo forse avete anche avuto notizia di questo è stata presentata una proposta spagnola che pure ma con qualche suggerimento di variazione potremmo appoggiare per la conformità alle caratteristiche e alle finalità che ho più sopra indicate ai paesi che condividono con noi la medesima linea di intervento abbiamo riservatamente anticipato anche una nostra proposta sempre in questa direzione che riteniamo pienamente conforme ad esempio all ’ art del trattato ma a noi interessa portare a casa un risultato non interessa in questo momento rivendicare una primazia in questo momento riteniamo opportuno condividere quanto più possibile le proposte sul tavolo senza rischiare di dividerci con la conseguenza di rallentare non ce lo possiamo permettere il processo decisionale europeo dobbiamo agire presto perché il ritardo comprometterebbe il risultato è un rischio che l ’ europa non l ’ italia l ’ europa non può correre dobbiamo affrettarci senza indugio a rafforzare la nostra casa comune e dobbiamo ripararla in fretta per sperare di competere anche tra le altre cose in modo efficace con le altre economie globali quest ’ ultimo aspetto vorrei dire non riveste una minore importanza al mantenimento di un equilibrato e sostenibile mercato interno fa evidentemente da corollario nell ’ azione esterna dell ’ unione europea quel “ level playing field ” quella parità di condizioni che le consentirebbe di restare al passo con i grandi player globali le consultazioni e concludo da me avute in questi giorni sia a livello che hanno fatto da subito emergere cosa che non smetto mai di segnalare ai miei omologhi la magnitudo dello spazio fiscale messo in campo pensate da usa dalla cina e dallo stesso giappone di fronte a ordini di grandezza di diversi trilioni di dollari la risposta complessiva europea non si è ancora configurata di livello adeguato è per questa ragione che non potrò accettare un compromesso al ribasso qui non siamo di fronte a un negoziato a somma zero non ci saranno alcuni vincitori e alcuni perdenti sono intimamente convinto parlando di europa che o vinceremo tutti o perderemo tutti il prossimo incontro europeo a livello di leader dei stati membri dell ’ unione europea non ritengo sarà quello risolutivo a questo fine ma farò di tutto perché esprima già il prossimo consiglio europeo un indirizzo politico chiaro nell ’ unica direzione che vi ho espresso l ’ unica direzione ragionevole grazie   \n",

      "4  gentile presidente onorevoli senatrici onorevoli senatori l ’ odierna informativa mi consente di offrire al parlamento un quadro compiuto delle più recenti iniziative che il governo ha adottato sul piano interno e un aggiornamento sulle iniziative che a livello europeo sono in programma per fronteggiare l ’ emergenza epidemiologica da questo passaggio viene compiuto nella chiara consapevolezza di chi vi parla ma anche dell ’ intero governo della necessità di coinvolgere appieno il parlamento in particolare in una fase in cui l ’ azione del governo per il carattere straordinario e la portata pervasiva dell ’ emergenza che stiamo affrontando rileva direttamente su beni primari della persona la salute la libertà l ’ iniziativa economica il lavoro a tacer d ’ altre veniamo alle iniziative adottate sul piano interno sulla legittimità e sulla ragionevolezza degli strumenti ai quali si è fatto ricorso come sapete è in atto un ampio dibattito molto articolato che riflette un variegato panorama di posizioni non entro evidentemente in questa discussione anche se non rimango affatto indifferente a tutte le questioni da essa sollevate desidero tuttavia ribadire qui proprio in quest ’ aula che la pandemia ha costretto a misure di estrema urgenza adottate sempre nel rispetto dei principi di massima precauzione e di proporzionalità in ogni più delicato passaggio ho sempre avuto la massima premura affinché fosse preservato il delicato complesso equilibrio fra i molteplici valori coinvolti tutti tutti di rango costituzionale e affinché fosse assicurato che i diversi organi costituzionali ciascuno espressione di irrinunciabili garanzie fossero coinvolti nella misura più ampia possibile soprattutto a tutela del principio supremo di democraticità che informa di sé l ’ intero ordinamento giuridico sotto il profilo della risposta sanitaria all ’ emergenza il governo ha elaborato in queste ultime settimane in particolare una strategia e su questa vi informiamo che possiamo sintetizzare in cinque punti mantenere e far rispettare a tutti i livelli le misure per il distanziamento sociale e promuovere l ’ utilizzo diffuso dei dispositivi di protezione individuale fino a quando non saranno disponibili una specifica terapia e un vaccino rafforzare le reti sanitarie del territorio come arma principale per combattere il virus a questo riguardo il governo si sta adoperando perché siano rafforzati tutti i servizi di prevenzione e sta sollecitando una rinnovata integrazione tra le politiche sanitarie e quelle sociali con particolare attenzione a case di cura e residenze sanitarie assistenziali ove si è verificata purtroppo un ’ esplosione incontrollata dei contagi specialmente in alcune aree del paese intensificare in tutto il territorio la presenza di “ covid hospital ” come strumento fondamentale della gestione ospedaliera dei pazienti la presenza di strutture dedicate esclusivamente al riduce notevolmente il rischio di contagio per gli operatori sanitari ma anche per i pazienti che sono ricoverati per altre malattie uso corretto dei test sia di quelli molecolari banalmente tampone che oggi sono l ’ unico strumento certo di identificazione del virus sia di quelli sierologici ad esempio l ’ analisi del sangue utile strumento di indagine e conoscenza epidemiologica anche al fine di predisporre un piano nazionale che potrà fotografare efficacemente lo stato epidemiologico del nostro paese al riguardo il aprile è stata indetta dal commissario arcuri su richiesta del ministero della salute una gara in procedura semplificata e di massima urgenza per la fornitura di kit reagenti e consumabili per l ’ effettuazione di test finalizzati ad un ’ indagine campione sulla diffusione dell ’ infezione nella popolazione italiana con possibile successiva estensione per l ’ effettuazione di ulteriori test la gara pubblica si concluderà in tempi strettissimi entro il aprile ci sarà ragionevolmente la sottoscrizione del contratto all ’ esito di una procedura trasparente e rigorosa rafforzamento della strategia di mappatura dei contatti sospetti ormai l ’ espressione è di uso comune contact trace e di teleassistenza con l ’ utilizzo delle nuove tecnologie l ’ immediatezza nella individuazione dei contatti stretti dei casi positivi e il loro conseguente isolamento sono cruciali per evitare che singoli contagiati possano determinare nuovi focolai per questo un ’ adeguata applicazione informativa direttamente disponibile su smartphone è uno strumento essenziale per accelerare questo processo attenzione però questa applicazione lo dico chiaramente sarà offerta su base volontaria e non su base obbligatoria e faremo in modo che chi non vorrà scaricarla non subirà limitazione nei movimenti o altri pregiudizi un team composto dal ministero dell ’ innovazione dal ministero della salute e da esperti in sicurezza cibernetica sta affiancando il commissario arcuri al fine di implementare questa applicazione nel migliore dei modi e con le più elevate garanzie ho dato indicazioni affinché i capigruppo di maggioranza ma anche di minoranza siano costantemente informati su questo processo applicativo io stesso mi riservo in una fase più avanzata di riferire puntualmente alle camere sui dettagli di questa applicazione nella consapevolezza che il coinvolgimento del parlamento deve essere pieno e stringente essendo coinvolti diritti costituzionali fondamentali penso alla dignità della persona penso al diritto alla riservatezza e all ’ identità personale come pure la tutela della salute pubblica e non ultima l ’ esigenza di proteggere un asset informativo di primaria importanza nella logica degli interessi strategici nazionali per quanto concerne la distribuzione di dispositivi sanitari e di protezione personale comunico che tramite il sistema “ ada analisi distribuzione aiuti ” aggiornato in tempo reale sono disponibili sui vari siti ufficiali del govern informazioni puntuali su dispositivi apparecchiature e distribuzione che ogni giorno il commissario arcuri invia alle regioni e alla province autonome per fronteggiare l ’ emergenza vi fornisco solo qualche dato riassuntivo per comprendere lo sforzo compiuto in un periodo in cui vi è una forsennata competizione di buona parte dei paesi ad accaparrarsi questi materiali al aprile risultano distribuiti alle regioni dalla protezione civile circa ventilatori per le terapie mila tubi endotracheali milioni di mascherine di varie tipologie con riguardo invece alle più generali misure contenitive adottate dal governo fin dall ’ inizio dell ’ emergenza e sulle quali ho riferito diffusamente nell ’ informativa precedente che risale al marzo scorso ricordo che in queste ultime settimane sono stati adottati due ulteriori decreti del presidente del consiglio dei ministri entrambi volti sostanzialmente a prorogare il regime restrittivo già in vigore con il dpcm del ° aprile è stata prorogata fino al aprile l ’ efficacia delle disposizioni dei decreti del presidente del consiglio dell ’ del dell ’ e del marzo nonché l ’ efficacia delle disposizioni previste in varie ordinanze ministeriali si tratta come è noto delle misure riguardanti il distanziamento sociale il divieto di spostamenti salvo comprovate esigenze la chiusura delle scuole e di altri luoghi di aggregazione la sospensione delle attività produttive industriali e commerciali ad eccezione di quelle che erogano servizi di pubblica utilità o servizi pubblici essenziali successivamente il aprile quelle stesse misure sempre con dpcm sono state prorogate quindi veniamo al sistema di disciplina vigente sino al maggio la decisione di prorogare ulteriormente quello che è comunemente omai denominato come lockdown è stata assunta alla luce dei dati epidemiologici delle ultime settimane con particolare riguardo all ’ andamento dei contagi questi dati hanno confermato l ’ efficacia delle misure di contenimento adottate ma contestualmente hanno suggerito l ’ esigenza di perseguire con immutato rigore lungo il percorso intrapreso affinché i risultati conseguiti non andassero perduti si prospetta adesso davanti a noi una fase molto complessa dobbiamo procedere a un allentamento del regime attuale delle restrizioni che riguardano le attività produttive e commerciali dobbiamo fare il possibile evidentemente per preservare l ’ integrità l ’ efficienza del nostro tessuto produttivo i motori del paese devono riavviarsi ma questo riavvio deve avvenire sulla base di un piano ben strutturato articolato che comporti una revisione dei modelli organizzativi di lavoro delle modalità del trasporto pubblico ma anche privato e di tutte le attività connesse anche per le misure di distanziamento sociale ci saranno alcune modifiche non mi sfugge non ci sfugge a tutti la difficoltà per i cittadini di continuare a osservare regole fortemente limitative della loro libertà di movimento che hanno implicato una profonda modifica delle nostre abitudini di vita il ritorno alla normalità seppure con la gradualità necessaria è un ’ aspirazione comprensibile di tutti tutte queste esigenze mi vengono rappresentate dai medesimi cittadini ma mi vengono sollecitate anche da molti di voi parlamentari che – nel momento in cui vi fate interpreti delle istanze provenienti dai territori dai diversi mondi mi avete scritto sollecitando soluzioni rapide soluzioni sostenibili e vi ringrazio di questo anche per questo reputo doveroso informare il parlamento circa la strategia che il governo sta elaborando proprio in questi giorni allo scopo di procedere a un progressivo ma ordinato allentamento delle misure per questa finalità con specifico dpcm sempre il aprile ho istituito un comitato di esperti in materia economica e sociale con il compito di elaborare proposte utili per orientare il governo nelle decisioni che dovrà assumere al riguardo questo comitato di esperti sta agendo di concerto con il comitato tecnicoscientifico affinché le strategie individuate per la ripartenza economica si basino su imprescindibili precondizioni di sicurezza sono membri di diritto di questo comitato di esperti anche il dott borrelli capo della protezione civile e il commissario straordinario dott arcuri in modo da ottenere il pieno coordinamento tra gli organi che ci coadiuvano in questa durissima sfida con l ’ ausilio di questi esperti stiamo elaborando un programma di progressive aperture che sia omogeneo su base nazionale e che ci consenta di riaprire buona parte delle attività produttive e anche commerciali tenendo però sotto controllo la curva del contagio questo è molto importante dobbiamo tenere sotto controllo la curva del contagio in modo da intervenire se è del caso anche successivamente laddove questa si rinnalzi oltre una certa soglia soglia che non pensiamo debba essere formulata in termini meramente astratti ma che vogliamo commisurata alla specifica recettività delle strutture ospedaliere dell ’ area di riferimento ovviamente per poter riprendere in sicurezza le attività economiche dovrà essere garantito il rispetto dei protocolli a partire da quello firmato il marzo scorso con i sindacati e le categorie produttive e successivamente aggiornato una volta completato questo programma lo discuteremo con tutti i soggetti coinvolti quindi anche enti territoriali organizzazioni datoriali sindacati al fine di acquisire le valutazioni e di condividerlo con tutti i soggetti interessati si tratta lo ripeto di uno dei passaggi più sensibili e più complessi siamo consapevoli infatti che un ’ imprudenza commessa in questa fase un ’ avventatezza in questa fase dettata semmai dalla legittima aspettativa di ripartire può in un momento in cui ancora non è esaurita ma solo contenuta la carica del contagio – compromettere tutti i sacrifici che con responsabilità e disciplina i cittadini hanno dovuto affrontare sin qui veniamo al sostegno all ’ economia lo scorso aprile è stato approvato il decretolegge n del attualmente all ’ esame della camera dei deputati per la sua conversione in legge in cui diventano operative nuove misure a supporto di imprese artigiani autonomi e professionisti il provvedimento prosegue e amplia lo spettro di interventi disposti nel decretolegge cd “ cura italia ” ed è incentrato su tre principali direttive a misure di sostegno alla liquidità delle imprese volte a sbloccare ulteriori flussi di finanziamento garantiti a beneficio del sistema produttivo b misure di tutela degli asset strategici nazionali c misure fiscali volte a prorogare le scadenze esistenti e a incentivare le spese sostenute dalle imprese per riaprire in sicurezza sostenere l ’ erogazione agevolata di liquidità alle imprese grazie alle garanzie pubbliche aiuta a prevenire fenomeni di interruzione del credito e del circuito dei pagamenti che rischia di compromettere la continuità delle attività economiche inoltre per evitare il rischio di una perdita permanente di capacità produttiva e di crescita potenziale del nostro paese è fondamentale accrescere la protezione del nostro tessuto industriale per questa ragione nel decretolegge avete trovato anche nuove misure a tutela degli asset strategici italiani abbiamo esteso l ’ applicativo della golden power a nuovi settori che non erano ricompresi e consideriamo anch ’ essi di rilevanza strategica abbiamo anche esteso la sua applicazione a operazioni infraeuropee che sino che sino a adesso rimanevano escluse questa emergenza sta incidendo sulle fasce più fragili della popolazione e rischia di creare nuove povertà quindi non possiamo ignorare questo fenomeno che rischia di lacerare un tessuto sociale già provato abbiamo compiuto alcuni primi passi per venire incontro alle urgenze dei cittadini che versano in condizioni di maggiore difficoltà ricordate il decreto dpcm del marzo con cui il governo ha anticipato ai comuni una quota del delle erogazioni previste dal fondo di solidarietà comunale pari a miliardi di euro che potranno essere utilizzati anche a ulteriore garanzia della piena funzionalità dei servizi pubblici erogati inoltre con un ’ ordinanza della protezione civile del marzo sono stati anticipati milioni di euro ai comuni italiani per consentire loro di distribuire aiuti alimentari ai cittadini più bisognosi sotto forma di buoni spesa o in alternativa di generi alimentari e di prima necessità consegnati in via diretta il governo però è consapevole che questi interventi non sono sufficienti e occorre un sostegno alle famiglie e alle imprese prolungato nel tempo ancora più incisivo la recessione indotta dalle necessarie misure di contenimento del virus infatti avrà un impatto profondo e persistente sull ’ intera economia le recenti previsioni del fondo monetario internazionale stimano una caduta del prodotto interno lordo del per il a cui seguirebbe poi una crescita del nel ecco di fronte a questo quadro dobbiamo potenziare ulteriormente la nostra risposta di politica economica per tale ragione in aggiunta ai miliardi di euro già stanziati con il cosiddetto decretolegge “ cura italia ” il governo invierà a brevissimo al parlamento un ’ ulteriore relazione contenente una richiesta di scostamento dagli obiettivi di bilancio precedenti per il pari a una cifra ben superiore a quella stanziata a marzo una cifra davvero consistente non inferiore a miliardi di euro che si aggiungeranno ai miliardi già stanziati per un intervento complessivo non inferiore a miliardi questo ulteriore ricorso al disavanzo servirà a finanziare varie misure destinate tra le altre al rafforzamento del personale sanitario della protezione civile e delle forze di sicurezza alla proroga e al rafforzamento degli ammortizzatori sociali in particolare la cassa integrazione e indennizzi per gli autonomi e le partite iva al sostegno di coloro che non sono coperti da cassa integrazione a misure di sostegno alle piccole e medie imprese a fondi aggiuntivi per comuni province città metropolitane e regioni agli interventi di sostegno dei settori particolarmente colpiti dalle misure di contenimento del virus sono consapevole che l ’ iter di conversione in legge dei decretilegge finora adottati ha lasciato parzialmente insoddisfatte le legittime aspettative delle forze politiche di poter contribuire con proprie proposte alla definizione del quadro degli interventi ringrazio sentitamente i gruppi parlamentari per la consapevolezza mostrata del contesto particolarmente critico nel quale in ragione dell ’ emergenza siamo costretti a operare assicuro che nella costruzione dell ’ ampio corpus di misure che troveranno collocazione nel prossimo decretolegge al quale ho fatto cenno sarà assicurata la massima attenzione alle istanze e alle proposte dei parlamentari anche in conformità agli impegni assunti dal governo e formalizzati in specifici ordini del giorno accolti in sede di esame parlamentare del decretolegge “ cura italia ” ringrazio in particolare la maggioranza che sostiene il governo i presidenti dei gruppi in primo luogo ma anche se mi permettete ogni singolo parlamentare per l ’ impegno la partecipazione l ’ apporto costruttivo anche quando critico per il sostegno che non state facendo mai mancare e in un momento così difficile per la vita della nazione desidero confermare la piena disponibilità al dialogo mia e dell ’ intero governo con le forze di opposizione il contributo di una opposizione responsabile e consapevole della gravità dell ’ ora troverà sempre apertura e considerazione la sfida che ci attende tuttavia non può essere affrontata efficacemente ricorrendo soltanto a politiche nazionali visto che il virus non conosce confini e sta pervasivamente incidendo sui tessuti economicosociali di molti paesi affinché tutti i paesi possano superare l ’ emergenza sanitaria ricostruire la propria società e la propria economia è necessario che le nazioni sappiano mettere in campo una risposta coordinata solidale l ’ ho ribadito in tutte le opportune sedi istituzionali – a livello di consiglio europeo l ’ unione europea e l ’ eurozona non possono permettersi di ripetere gli errori commessi durante la crisi finanziaria del allora non si riuscì ad affrontare in modo coordinato unito e solidale uno shock comune si decise addirittura un consolidamento fiscale affrettato e ingiustificato che amplificando le divergenze fra i paesi produsse un secondo shock di natura asimmetrica nel portando come sappiamo e ricordiamo – alla crisi dei debiti sovrani condannando l ’ europa a una recessione più prolungata e a una ripresa più lenta e più debole rispetto alle altre maggiori aree economiche del mondo è un rischio che adesso non ci possiamo permettere di correre poiché il fallimento nel produrre una risposta adeguata e coraggiosa porterebbe inevitabilmente – grave danno allo stesso progetto europeo l ’ eurogruppo dello scorso aprile ha preparato un rapporto per la risposta economica dell ’ unione all ’ emergenza sanitaria ed economica che oltre a tenere conto dei progressi compiuti predispone un pacchetto di strumenti a disposizione degli stati membri composto da quattro elementi principali innanzitutto viene costituito un fondo di garanzia europeo presso la banca europea degli investimenti la bei dotato di miliardi di euro che dovrebbe consentire l ’ attivazione fino a miliardi di euro di finanziamenti per gli investimenti all ’ interno dell ’ unione il secondo elemento del pacchetto è il cosiddetto piano “ sure ” uno strumento di assistenza finanziaria che potrà erogare fino a miliardi in linee di credito dedicate alle misure di sostegno al reddito dei lavoratori temporaneamente privi di impiego questi due elementi seppure ancora insufficienti già si caratterizzano per un finanziamento con garanzie comuni e quindi a tassi di interesse bassi per spese e investimenti da effettuare nei paesi membri sul terzo elemento del pacchetto ovvero l ’ attivazione di una linea di credito dedicata alle spese sanitarie ed erogata dal meccanismo europeo di stabilità l ’ ormai strafamoso mes si è alimentato nelle ultime settimane un dibattito che rischia di dividere l ’ italia in opposte tifoserie l ’ europa non deve ritrovarsi nuovamente a chiedere scusa nei confronti di nessun paese come è successo in passato quando ha imposto alla grecia programmi particolarmente severi di qui la mia posizione di assoluta cautela di fronte alla sfida epocale che abbiamo di fronte non si può pensare che la risposta possa essere affidata a interventi modesti peraltro sul piano finanziario e per di più basati su un accordo intergovernativo come il mes pensato per gestire crisi assai diverse riguardanti singoli paesi imputabili a squilibri di natura economica per questo è stato concepito in virtù di decisione prese nel passato per come è stato concepito è uno strumento che ha sin qui espresso linee di finanziamento caratterizzate da forti condizionalità macroeconomiche e che per di più ha consentito di dosare l ’ imposizione di misure fiscali al soggetto finanziato via via sempre più stringenti tutte cose che io ritengo inaccettabili data la natura di questa crisi insieme ad altri otto paesi membri l ’ italia ha lanciato una sfida ambiziosa all ’ europa invitandola a introdurre nuovi strumenti per affrontare e superare al più presto questa crisi alcuni di questi paesi che hanno condiviso questa nostra impostazione hanno dichiarato da subito – e voglio anche dirlo esplicitamente la spagna di essere interessati al mes purché non abbia le rigide condizionalità applicate in altre circostanze ma solo la condizione che l ’ utilizzo del finanziamento sia per far fronte alle spese sanitarie dirette o indirette che siano rifiutare la nuova linea di credito significherebbe fare un torto ai paesi che pure sono a noi affiancati in questa battaglia e che intendono invece usufruirne resto però convinto che all ’ italia serva altro all ’ ultima riunione dell ’ eurogruppo è stato compiuto un deciso passo avanti in questa nuova direzione nel paragrafo relativo all ’ utilizzo del mes è stata proposta come sapete una nuova linea di credito chiamata “ pandemic crisis support ” e adattata alla natura simmetrica dello shock legato al soggetta alla sola condizione dell ’ utilizzo del finanziamento per le spese sanitarie e di prevenzione dirette e indirette per capire se effettivamente sarà così bisognerà però attendere l ’ elaborazione dei vari documenti relativi ai termini di finanziamento che verranno predisposti per erogare questa nuova linea di credito su questo versante mi attendo ulteriori peraltro chiare prese di posizione anche in seno al consiglio europeo e in ogni caso siamo disponibili a lavorare con i paesi direttamente interessati a questa nuova linea di credito affinché anche in sede regolamentare comunque non siano introdotte condizionalità di sorta macroeconomiche o anche più specifiche quanti oggi esprimono dubbi e perplessità su questa nuova linea di credito a mio avviso a mio personale avviso contribuiscono a un dibattito democratico e costruttivo e sono io il primo a dire che bisognerà valutare attentamente i dettagli dell ’ accordo solo allora potremo valutare in via conclusiva se questa nuova linea di credito pone condizioni quali condizioni pone e solo allora potremo discutere se il relativo regolamento può essere o meno conforme all ’ interesse nazionale se può essere o meno conveniente e opportuno rispetto agli interessi nazionali ho già dichiarato in altre sedi ritengo che questa discussione in un paese civile e democratico debba avvenire in modo pubblico e trasparente dinanzi al parlamento al quale spetterà l ’ ultima parola ma la verità è che la trattativa in cui siamo impegnati in europa è particolarmente complessa perché la risposta comune non può poggiare solo su queste misure deve essere ben più efficace ben più consistente noi siamo ben convinti della forza delle nostre ragioni all ’ inizio eravamo soli nelle scorse settimane ho però proposto una lettera un vero e proprio manifesto programmatico che è stato sottoscritto da altri paesi che ora sono con noi a chiedere strumenti nuovi adatti alla situazione eccezionale che stiamo vivendo il quarto elemento del pacchetto è un pezzo fondamentale della nostra strategia europea uno european recovery fund che possa finanziare progetti comuni di interesse europeo per avviare un piano di ricostruzione fondato sugli investimenti l ’ innovazione la sostenibilità ambientale la tutela della salute e dell ’ ambiente il rapporto dell ’ eurogruppo dello scorso aprile richiama la necessità di costruire questo strumento che l ’ italia intende realizzare quanto più velocemente possibile strutturandolo come un veicolo in grado di finanziarsi con debito comune sui mercati finanziari sarà questo il tema della riunione della videoconferenza dei membri del consiglio europeo prevista per il prossimo giovedì aprile l ’ italia insieme agli altri paesi che condividono questa medesima strategia sostiene la necessità di una risposta coordinata e ambiziosa allo shock da con la conseguenza che questo nuovo strumento di finanziamento dovrà essere conforme ai trattati europei perché non abbiamo il tempo di operare modifiche che comporterebbero una lunga e complessa procedura gestito a livello europeo e offerto a tutti i paesi interessati senza che possa assumere un carattere bilaterale dovrà essere particolarmente consistente quanto alla dimensione finanziaria ben più consistente degli strumenti di cui attualmente si parla dovrà essere mirato a far fronte a tutte le conseguenze negative economiche e sociali prodotte dal dovrà essere immediatamente disponibile e se pure verrà a ricadere sul nuovo quadro finanziario pluriennale dovrà essere messo a disposizione di tutti i paesi interessati subito è possibile farlo tecnicamente attraverso un meccanismo di garanzie che ne anticipino l ’ applicazione cd bridge non dovrà avere le condizionalità infine penso anche in termini di cofinanziamento di modalità di spesa che caratterizzano gli ordinari piani di finanziamento strutturali dell ’ unione europea al momento abbiamo un ’ iniziativa della presidente della commissione europea ursula von der leyen che per quanto da essa stessa mi è stato specificamente anticipato potrebbe avere queste caratteristiche e muovere proprio in questa direzione sul tavolo vi è anche una proposta francese se ne è parlato anche nei giornali che legherebbe il recovery fund a un veicolo costruito ad hoc in grado di emettere strumenti di debito comune e di erogare fondi ai paesi membri noi appoggiamo questa proposta francese avendo chiesto di integrarla rispetto alla sua originaria formulazione in modo da rispondere più puntualmente e ampiamente ai requisiti che ho indicato e che riteniamo imprescindibili da ultimo forse avete anche avuto notizia di questo è stata presentata una proposta spagnola che pure ma con qualche suggerimento di variazione potremmo appoggiare per la conformità alle caratteristiche e alle finalità che ho più sopra indicate ai paesi che condividono con noi la medesima linea di intervento abbiamo riservatamente anticipato anche una nostra proposta sempre in questa direzione che riteniamo pienamente conforme ad esempio all ’ art del trattato ma a noi interessa portare a casa un risultato non interessa in questo momento rivendicare una primazia in questo momento riteniamo opportuno condividere quanto più possibile le proposte sul tavolo senza rischiare di dividerci con la conseguenza di rallentare non ce lo possiamo permettere il processo decisionale europeo dobbiamo agire presto perché il ritardo comprometterebbe il risultato è un rischio che l ’ europa non l ’ italia l ’ europa non può correre dobbiamo affrettarci senza indugio a rafforzare la nostra casa comune e dobbiamo ripararla in fretta per sperare di competere anche tra le altre cose in modo efficace con le altre economie globali quest ’ ultimo aspetto vorrei dire non riveste una minore importanza al mantenimento di un equilibrato e sostenibile mercato interno fa evidentemente da corollario nell ’ azione esterna dell ’ unione europea quel “ level play field ” quella parità di condizioni che le consentirebbe di restare al passo con i grandi players globali le consultazioni e concludo da me avute in questi giorni sia a livello che hanno fatto da subito emergere cosa che non smetto mai di segnalare ai miei omologhi la magnitudo dello spazio fiscale messo in campo pensate da usa dalla cina e dallo stesso giappone di fronte a ordini di grandezza di diversi trilioni di dollari la risposta complessiva europea non si è ancora configurata di livello adeguato è per questa ragione che non potrò accettare un compromesso al ribasso qui non siamo di fronte a un negoziato a somma zero non ci saranno alcuni vincitori e alcuni perdenti sono intimamente convinto parlando di europa che o vinceremo tutti o perderemo tutti il prossimo incontro europeo a livello di leader dei stati membri dell ’ unione europea non ritengo sarà quello risolutivo a questo fine ma farò di tutto perché esprima già il prossimo consiglio europeo un indirizzo politico chiaro nell ’ unica direzione che vi ho espresso l ’ unica direzione ragionevole grazie  \n"
